     NAME
          purgepath - Purge directories from a directory path list

     SYNOPSIS
          purgepath [ -V ] [ -p _p_a_t_h_l_i_s_t(_n_a_m_e) ]... [ _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y ]...

     DESCRIPTION
          Takes the specified  path  list  (colon  separated  list  of
          directories)  and  prints  the  path list with the specified
          _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y/_i_e_s removed.  If no _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_i_e_s are specified, the
          current directory (.) is assumed.

          The _p_a_t_h_l_i_s_t(_n_a_m_e) may be either the  name  of  an  exported
          environment variable containing the path list (_e._g. CDPATH),
          or the actual path list (_e._g. $PATH:$CDPATH).  The  presence
          of  a colon (:), slash (/), dot (.) or dash (-) in the argu-
          ment indicates the latter.  If no -p  option  is  specified,
          PATH  is  assumed.  If more than one -p option is specified,
          later path lists are concatenated into an accumulating  path
          list with a separating colon supplied:
             -pCDPATH -p:/etc:/lib
          (There will be 2 colons between the contents of  CDPATH  and
          the /etc:/lib part.)

          Since _p_u_r_g_e_p_a_t_h allows more than one -p option, it  can  add
          directories  to  and  subtract directories from a path list,
          and is thus, a general path list construction  tool,  as  in
          the examples below.

          Each of the directories from the path  list  are  normalized
          similarly to normfile(1) with compression.  Then, the speci-
          fied _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_ys are normalized and tested against  the  nor-
          malized  directories  from the path list.  Each _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is
          removed from  the  path  list.   After  all  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_ys  are
          removed  from  the path list the result is output (using the
          normalized directory names).

          The -V option reports the program  version  number,  and  if
          there are no other command line arguments, simply exits.

     EXIT CODES
          0 = OK, 1 = non-fatal error, -1 = fatal error.

     EXAMPLES
          path=`purgepath /etc` # I don't want /etc in my PATH.
          PATH=${path:-$PATH}

          # I want to add /lib and remove my parent directory from CDPATH:
          path=`purgepath  -pCDPATH  -p/lib  ..`
          CDPATH=${path:-$CDPATH}

          # Remove invalid directory "/etc/etc" accidentally put in my PATH:
          path=`purgepath /etc/etc`
          PATH=${path:-$PATH}

          # Move the /usr/add-on/wwb/bin directory to the end of the PATH:
          path=`purgepath /usr/add-on/wwb/bin`:/usr/add-on/wwb/bin
          PATH=${path:-$PATH}

          splitpath(1), where(1)

     WARNINGS
          As with all pathlist-changing commands, you should  use  the
          form:
             dummy=`command ...`
             REALPATH=${dummy:-$REALPATH}
          so that the real path list does not get cleared if something
          goes wrong with the command.
