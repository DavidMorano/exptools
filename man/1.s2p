NAME
     s2p - Sed to Perl translator

SYNOPSIS
     s2p [options] filename

DESCRIPTION
     _S_2_p takes a sed script specified on  the  command  line  (or
     from  standard  input) and produces a comparable _p_e_r_l script
     on the standard output.

     Options

     Options include:

     -D<number>
          sets debugging flags.

     -n   specifies that this sed script was always invoked  with
          a  sed  -n.   Otherwise a switch parser is prepended to
          the front of the script.

     -p   specifies that this sed script was never invoked with a
          sed  -n.  Otherwise a switch parser is prepended to the
          front of the script.

     Considerations

     The perl script produced looks very sed-ish, and  there  may
     very  well  be better ways to express what you want to do in
     perl.  For instance, s2p does not make any use of the  split
     operator, but you might want to.

     The perl script you end up with  may  be  either  faster  or
     slower  than  the  original  sed  script.   If  you're  only
     interested in speed you'll just have to try  it  both  ways.
     Of  course,  if you want to do something sed doesn't do, you
     have no choice.  It's often possible to speed  up  the  perl
     script  by  various methods, such as deleting all references
     to $\ and chop.

ENVIRONMENT
     S2p uses no environment variables.
