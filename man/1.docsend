            _d_o_c_s_e_n_d invokes the special _n_r_o_f_f/_t_r_o_f_f macros needed to
            format a document source file, prints a paper copy of the
            document, and sends an electronic copy of the document to
            the Library Network UNIX system.  Both hardcopy and elec-
            tronic versions are time-stamped to permit subsequent match-
            ing.

            _d_o_c_s_e_n_d with the ----mmmmccccssss option (current default) uses the -_m_c_s
            cover sheet macros to format a cover sheet source file and
            generates a hardcopy version of the document cover sheet on
            the Xerox or Kodak PostScript high-speed page printers;
            Imagen Imprint-10, Imagen 8/300, or QMS PostScript laser
            printers; or DASI 450 (or DIABLO 630) terminal.  See _m_c_s(_5)
            for details about the -_m_c_s macros.

            When the approved paper version is received by the Internal
            Technical Document Service (ITDS), the matching electronic
            copy is retrieved and used as the source of data entered
            into the ITDS database.

            _d_o_c_s_e_n_d helps AT&T cut costs by eliminating redundant retyp-
            ing of coversheets by ITDS personnel. In addition, the
            author is ensured that the complete abstract is included in
            the ITDS database (rather than the 8 lines customarily pro-
            vided by ITDS manual entry).

            If no input filename is specified, file ``temp.cover'' is
            used by default.  Preprocessing with _e_q_n or _n_e_q_n is handled
            automatically, if needed.  Default device varies with ins-
            tallation.

            The following options may appear in any order preceding the
            filename:

            ----mmmmccccssss      Prepend the special -_m_c_s macro file to the input
                      file, format, and generate a document cover sheet
                      (the default).

            _d_o_c_s_e_n_d invokes a special stand-alone nroff/troff macro
            package developed specifically for use in the preparation of
            the G.E.I.-required document cover sheet.  Currently, AT&T
            Bell Laboratories (default), AT&T Information Systems, AT&T
            Technologies, Inc., and AT&T Corporate Headquarters (ERC)
            are supported in the macros.

            The new macros are styled after the Memorandum Macros but
            the two macro packages are not compatible and should NOT be
            used together.

            The macros currently provide facilities for generating para-
            graphs and footnotes as well as handling the specific for-
            matting requirements of the new cover sheet. Additional
            capabilities will be added if warranted by user interest.

            A list of the macro commands follows.

            AT&T Company

              .aC code

            The .aC macro is used to designate the AT&T company for whom
            the cover sheet is generated. Legal codes and the
            corresponding companies are:

                    BL      AT&T Bell Laboratories
                    IS      AT&T Information Systems
                    TI      AT&T Technologies, Inc.
                    CH      AT&T Corporate Headquarters (ERC)

            If the macro is omitted, the default AT&T company is AT&T
            Bell Laboratories.

            Title

              .TL
              one or more lines of title text

            No arguments to the .TL macro are expected and any supplied
            are ignored.  The title follows the .TL macro and is pro-
            cessed in fill mode.

            This macro is required for the document cover sheet.  The
            title is used on the first page of the cover sheet and is
            also included near the top of any continuation pages
            required in the case of abstract or distribution list over-
            flow.

            Author(s)

              .AU name "" loc dept ext room AT&T_company

            The .AU macro receives as arguments information that
            describes an author.  If any argument contains blanks, it
            must be enclosed within double quotes.  The arguments must
            appear in the order given.  The second argument is ignored
            by the cover sheet macros but is defined for compatibility
            with the Memorandum Macros. A null argument ("") should be
            supplied.

            The seventh argument (AT&T company) should be supplied only
            when different from the AT&T company for whom the cover
            sheet is generated (.aC macro or default).

            A separate .AU macro is required for each author. At least
            one .AU macro is required for each document cover sheet.

            Responsible Person

              .rP name

            The .rP macro is used to supply the name of a responsible
            person from the AT&T company for whom the cover sheet is
            generated (.aC macro or default) when there is no author
            representing that company. The macro is optional.

            page.

            No arguments to the .AS macro are expected and any supplied
            are ignored.

            Abstracts are required for cover sheets of technical and
            internal memoranda.

            Other Keywords

              .OK [keyword] ...

            Up to nine topical keywords or keyword phrases may be speci-
            fied as arguments to the optional .OK macro. If any keyword
            contains spaces, it must be enclosed within double quotes.

            Memorandum Type

              .MT type

            Legal codes for "type" and the corresponding values are:

                                1    Technical Memorandum
                                2    Internal Memorandum
                                3    Technical Correspondence

            No other values are recognized. No other arguments are
            expected.

            This macro is required for all cover sheets. It causes the
            character string "TM", "IM", or "TC" to be appended to the
            numeric portion of the document number defined with each .dN
            macro.  It also places the string "for Technical Memoran-
            dum", "for Internal Memorandum" or "for Technical Correspon-
            dence" under the words "Document Cover Sheet" at the top of
            page 1 (and on continuation pages).

            Software

              .sF

            If the document contains software (any nontrivial executable
            computer program routine), include the .sF macro.  This
            causes a trailing 'S' to be appended to each document number
            string constructed from data supplied by the .dN and .MT
            macros.  If the document does not contain software, omit the
            macro.

            A document number (assigned to each document by each issuing
            organization) consists of the organization number, date,
            sequence number, category suffix, and possible software suf-
            fix.  An example of a complete AT&T-BL document number is
            "79111-870630-02TMS".

            The first three elements (the numeric portion of the docu-
            ment number) are supplied by the first argument of the .dN
            macro.  Dashes separate the fields.

            The "organization" field for AT&T-BL and AT&T Corporate
            Headquarters (ERC) has at most 5 digits (10 digits for the
            other defined companies); the "date" field has 2 digits
            (year) for AT&T Technologies, Inc. and 6 digits (year month
            day) for the other defined companies; the "sequence number"
            field has 2 digits.  Examples of the numeric portion of a
            document number:

                                79111-870930-02     (BL)
                                XMPF70000-870930-01 (IS)
                                11NW500000-87-01    (TI)
                                60313-870930-01     (CH)

            At least one .dN macro is required for every cover sheet.
            If the document has multiple authors, there should be one
            .dN macro for each organization represented.

            Document numbers appear on the first page of the cover
            sheet. The first document number also appears at the very
            top of the second page and any succeeding continuation
            pages.

            Full Date

              .fD date

            The .fD macro is used for AT&T Technologies, Inc.  cover
            sheets only.  At least one full date must be specified for
            each document.  The date has 6 digits (year month day).

            Filing Case(s)

              .fC filing_case

            The .fC macro is used to supply the filing case (and sub-
            case, if applicable) for the document. If multiple filing
            cases pertain to the document, a separate .fC macro should
            be used for each. At least one .fC macro is required for
            AT&T-BL and AT&T-IS cover sheets (none for AT&T Technolo-
            gies, Inc. and AT&T Corporate Headquarters (ERC)).

              .wP work_project_number

            The .wP macro is used to supply the work project number for
            the document.  If multiple work project numbers pertain to
            the document, a separate .wP macro should be used for each.
            At least one .wP macro is required.

            MERCURY Announcement Bulletin Sections

              .mC [code] [code] [code]

            One or more MERCURY classifications (maximum 3) can be
            specified by supplying MERCURY codes as arguments to the .mC
            macro. Legal codes and the corresponding MERCURY classifica-
            tions are as follows:

                    chm     Chemistry and Materials
                    cmm     Communications
                    cmp     Computing
                    elc     Electronics
                    lfs     Life Sciences

                    mas     Mathematics and Statistics
                    mkt     Marketing
                    phy     Physics
                    std     Standards

            At least one MERCURY classification must be supplied for
            technical memoranda.

            Proprietary Markings

              .PM [code]

            By default, the AT&T - PROPRIETARY marking is placed near
            the bottom left-hand corner of the first page of the cover
            sheet.

            The .PM macro allows the alternate selection of the AT&T -
            PROPRIETARY (RESTRICTED) marking by specifying the code
            "RS".

            If the PROPRIETARY (RESTRICTED) marking is selected, use the
            space in the new Organization Approval section on page 2 of
            the cover sheet for the required approval by the responsible
            department head(s).  The space may be used for optional
            organizational approval for documents with the PROPRIETARY
            marking.

            If the document carries a government security classifica-
            tion, include the .gS macro.  This causes an appropriate
            section to be generated on page 2 of the cover sheet.  If
            the document is not government security classified, omit the
            macro.

            Earlier Document Number

              .eD complete_document_number

            If the document supersedes or amends an earlier document,
            include the .eD macro followed by the complete document
            number (including TM/IM/TC/S suffix) of the earlier docu-
            ment.

            Future AT&T Distribution by ITDS

              .fA code

            The .fA macro is used to indicate the policy that ITDS
            should follow concerning the Future Distribution of the
            document to AT&T employees (excluding contract employees).

            Although this macro is not currently required, it is impor-
            tant to provide it for all cover sheets.  Otherwise, you
            will be contacted by ITDS for the necessary decision.

            The .fA macro with code of "y" indicates that you authorize
            ITDS to release the document to any AT&T employee (except
            contract employees).

            Conversely, the .fA macro with code of "n" indicates that
            you want ITDS to obtain appropriate approval for each
            request for the document.

            NOTE: AT&T PROPRIETARY (RESTRICTED) documents require appro-
            val for each request (i.e. .fA with "n" code).

            Initial Distribution Specifications

              .cC
              list of names for complete copy distribution (one per line)
              .cE
              .cS
              list of names for cover sheet only distribution (one per line)
              .cE

            Space is provided on page 2 of the cover sheet for the ini-
            tial distribution specifications. Use the optional .cC (com-
            plete copy) macro to mark the beginning of the list of names
            to receive a complete copy of the document and .cE (end
            list) to mark the end of the list. Use the optional .cS

            (cover only) macro to mark the beginning of the list of
            names to receive the document cover sheet only and .cE (end
            list) to mark the end of the list. For non-AT&T-BL reci-
            pients add tab character and company name after the addres-
            see name.  The .cC, .cS and .cE macros do not expect argu-
            ments and any supplied will be ignored.

            The number of names provided on page 2 of the cover sheet
            varies according to the amount of space consumed by some of
            the optional sections. Overflow will be printed either on a
            separate continuation sheet or at the end of the abstract
            overflow (if one exists and if the overflow names will fit).
            Any overflow that will not fit on one continuation sheet
            will be lost.

            Cover Sheet

              .CS pages other "" "" "" ""

            The required .CS macro actually generates the cover sheet
            from the information provided by its arguments and by the
            other macros.  If the third argument is supplied, it is
            interpreted as "total pages (including document cover
            sheet)". Otherwise, the macros automatically calculate this
            total by adding the figures in the first and second argu-
            ments to the number of pages generated in the cover sheet
            itself.  All other .CS arguments are ignored but are defined
            for compatibility with the Memorandum Macros.  Null argu-
            ments ("") should be supplied.

            Order of Invocation of Macros

            The macros described above, if present, should be given in
            the following order:

              .aC code

              one or more cover sheet addressees - one per line
              .cE
              .CS pages other "" "" "" ""

            The only macros required for the document cover sheet are:
            .TL, .AU (at least one), .AS and .AE (for technical and
            internal memoranda), .MT, .dN (at least one), .fC (at least
            one for AT&T-BL and AT&T-IS only), .fD (at least one for
            AT&T Technologies, Inc.  only), .wP (at least one), and .CS.
            All arguments to these macros must be supplied.  In addi-
            tion, at least one MERCURY classification (.mC macro) must
            be supplied for technical memoranda.  Although not currently
            required, it is also important to include the .fA macro with
            "y" or "n" code.

            Paragraphs

              .P [type]

            The .P macro marks the beginning of a paragraph and may be
            used within the text of the abstract. .P without argument or
            with an argument of "0" produces a left-adjusted paragraph.
            .P with argument of "1" produces a paragraph that is
            indented 5 spaces.

            Footnotes

              .FS [label]
              one or more lines of footnote text
              .FE

            The .FS and .FE macros mark the beginning and end of foot-
            note text and may be used in the title or author sections or
            within the abstract.

            The footnote macros and text should be typed on the lines
            immediately following the word being footnoted. The footnote
            label, if present, will be used to mark the footnote text.
            The label should also be typed at the end of the footnoted
            word.

            Footnotes used within the title or author sections appear in
            the lower left portion of page 1 of the cover sheet. Foot-
            notes used within the abstract itself appear at the end of
            the abstract text.

              .VL text-indent [mark-indent] [1]
              .LI mark [1]
              one or more line of text that make up the list item
              .LE [1]

            A variable-item list must include the .VL macro, the .LI
            macro with mandatory first argument (the mark), and the .LE
            macro.

            The required .VL text-indent gives the distance from the
            current indent to the beginning of the text. The optional
            mark-indent gives the number of spaces from the current
            indent to the beginning of the mark (default 0 if omitted or
            null). If the third argument is specified, no blank lines
            will separate the items in the list.

            If two arguments are supplied to the .LI macro, the first
            argument becomes a prefix to the mark, thus allowing the
            user to emphasize one or more items in a list. One unpadd-
            able space is inserted between the prefix and the mark.
            Multiple .LI macros can be used between the .VL and .LE.

            The .LE marks the end of the variable-item list. If the
            optional argument is given, the .LE outputs a blank line
            (1/2 vertical space).

            Marked List

              .ML mark [text-indent] [1]
              .LI [mark] [1]
              one or more lines of text that make up the list item
              .LE [1]

            A marked list must include the .ML, .LI, and .LE macros.

            The mark is supplied by the first argument to the .ML macro.
            Text is indented text-indent spaces if the second argument
            is not null; otherwise, the text is indented one more space
            than the width of mark. If the third argument is specified,
            no blank lines will separate the items in the list.

            If a single argument is given to .LI, that argument is out-
            put instead of the current mark. If two arguments are given,
            the first argument becomes a prefix to the current mark,
            thus allowing the user to emphasize one or more items in a
            list. One unpaddable space is inserted between the prefix
            and the mark. Multiple .LI macros can be used between the
            .ML and .LE.

            The .LE marks the end of the marked list. If the optional
            argument is given, the .LE outputs a blank line (1/2 verti-
            cal space).

            The marked list may be used to generate a bullet list by
            supplying the bullet character (\(bu) as the mark.

            Static Displays

              .DS [format] [fill] [rindent]
              one or more lines of text
              .DE

            A static display is started by the .DS macro and terminated
            by the .DE macro.  With no arguments, .DS will accept lines
            of text exactly as they are typed (no-fill) and will not
            indent them from the prevailing left margin indentation or
            from the right margin. The rindent argument is the number of
            characters that the line length should be decreased, i.e. an
            indentation from the right margin.

            The format argument to .DS is an integer or letter used to
            control the left margin indentation and centering with the
            following meanings:

                                0 or L    no indent (default)
                                1 or I    indent 5 spaces
                                2 or C    center each line
                                3 or CB   center as a block

            The fill argument is also an integer or letter and can have
            the following meanings:

                                0 or N    no-fill mode (default)
                                1 or F    fill mode

            Omitted arguments are taken to be zero.

            Display format value 3 (CB) must be used in order for the
            eqn/neqn "mark" and "lineup" feature to work with centered
            equations.

            Equations

              .DS
              .EQ [label]
              equation(s)
              .EN
              .DE

            The equation setters eqn and neqn expect to use the .EQ
            (equation start) and .EN (equation end) macros as delim-
            iters. The .EQ and .EN must occur inside a .DS/.DE pair
            (unless the .EQ and .EN are used only to specify the delim-
            iters for in-line equations or to specify eqn/neqn
            "defines").

            The .EQ macro takes an argument that will be used a a label
            for the equation.  By default, the label will appear at the
            right margin of the general equation.

            The equation will be centered for centered displays; other-
            wise, the equation will be adjusted to the opposite margin
            from the label.

            Points to Note

            A trademark string \*(Tm is available with the macros. This
            places the letters "TM" one-half line above the text that it
            follows.

            The .aC (AT&T company) and .mC (MERCURY) macros are defined
            in all versions of the csmacros beginning 6/30/85.  The .mC
            macro should be used to specify MERCURY codes instead of the
            earlier .mE macro (which supported only the seven original
            MERCURY codes).

            The .cI (CI-II Review) macro should no longer be used.

            The .eD (earlier document) macro is defined in all versions
            of the csmacros beginning 5/30/87. Other changes introduced
            at this time include: a new code "CH" for use with the .aC
            macro to produce cover sheets for AT&T Corporate Headquar-
            ters (ERC); a new code "RS" for use with the .PM macro to
            generate the AT&T - PROPRIETARY (RESTRICTED) marking.

            Finally, if the third argument of the .CS macro is supplied,
            it is interpreted as "total pages (including document cover
            sheet)".  Otherwise, the macros automatically calculate this
            total by adding the figures in the first and second argu-
            ments to the number of pages generated in the cover sheet
            itself.  All other .CS arguments are ignored.

            The .fA (Future AT&T Distribution) macro is defined in all
            versions of the csmacros beginning 7/20/87.  It supercedes
            the .rA (release approval) macro which was introduced in the
            csmacros beginning 5/30/87.

            Because the -_m_c_s macro package uses sizes not available on
            the Xerox high-speed printer, _t_r_o_f_f and _d_x_9_7_0_0 may generate
            a stream of error messages warning of size mapping which,
            along with all other error messages, have been redirected
            (overwrite) to file "err._p_r_o_c_e_s_s_#".  Fatal "ERROR" messages
            and certain "WARNING" messages generated by the cover sheets
            macros are also written to this file and mailed to the user.

            The -_m_c_s .CS macro has been redefined.  See _m_c_s(_5).  Only
            one argument is now recognized and all other arguments are
            ignored. The argument represents the total page count of the
            document (NOT including the pages of the cover sheet
            itself).

            Not all devices are available at every location.

            No checking is done within _d_o_c_s_e_n_d for valid destination
            names.

            Source files should NOT be preprocessed with _e_q_n or _n_e_q_n.

            Strange page-order sometimes results with the ----2222 option when
            the cover sheet has more than two pages.

            Format and print commands for each supported device are set
            up within _d_o_c_s_e_n_d at the time of installation.  The ----vvvv
            option may be used with the various ----TTTT options to check the
            predefined command values.  The ----TTTTllllooooccccaaaallll option can be used
            to redefine format (and print) commands, if necessary, as
            well as to handle unsupported devices.

            Only those -_m_m macros that are listed on the _m_c_s(5) manual
            page can be used to format document cover sheet title and
            abstract text. Refer to the _m_c_s(5) manual page.
