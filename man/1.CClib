          The CCCCCCCClllliiiibbbb command provides a guide to a set of C++ class
          libraries, including source, donated by members of AT&T for
          the use of development within the company.  Library
          providers have donated their code so that others within the
          company need not recreate similar pieces of software, and
          users should view CClib code mainly as a time-saving device.
          THERE IS NO EXPLICIT OR IMPLICIT GUARANTEED LEVEL OF SUPPORT
          FOR ANY GIVEN LIBRARY.  All support decisions are at the
          option of the library provider.

          Each library has one related directory in $TOOLS/lib/CClib
          in which to place relevant files such as source, headers,
          tests, makefiles, READMEs, etc. A man page for the library
          is guaranteed to be available in $TOOLS/lib/CClib/man.

          The CCCCCCCClllliiiibbbb command gives an abbreviated version of this man
          page as well as a directory of current library offerings.
          The directory lists each library name and description,
          location, target machines, and provider.  The directory also
          lists any known dependencies among the libraries that must
          be known to properly link two or more libraries together.

          It is the intent of CClib to offer libraries that are of
          general interest.  Any member of AT&T owning such a C++
          library that they wish to share should read the short set of
          instructions under toolnews CClib.  Before completing
          libraries for CClib, authors are encouraged to obtain
          current guidelines for coding conventions and man page
          formation from active programming groups within AT&T.  A
          query to the netnews group att.lang.c++ or other active C++
          mailing lists would likely produce any guidelines that
          currently exist.

          There is no standard in CClib as to how extensively a
          library has been tested.  The amount of testing that each
          library has experienced is solely at the discretion of the
          provider.

          Bugs, proposed fixes, and comments should be sent to the
          library provider of the relevant library listed in CCCCCCCClllliiiibbbb.... As
          a courtesy to other users of the given library, users are
          also requested to send their bugs, proposed fixes, and
          comments to the netnews group att.lang.c++.

          Libraries in CClib may be updated on occasion.  Providers
          can announce an impending change by posting a notice to
          att.lang.c++.  It is the responsibility of the user to check
          this newsgroup for change announcements.

          A library that is slated to be updated will remain intact up
          to the last day of the month in which the announcement is
          made, after which time (within the first few days of the
          next month) the new version will update the old.  The source
          for each library will include a release date to help the
          user distinguish between versions.  Users should check
          att.lang.c++ at the end of each month to protect versions
          that they need.  If a large library is changed, users are
          encouraged to voice their opinion to the library provider
          and att.lang.c++ as to the relative worth of the old and new
          versions, to avoid having many copies of large libraries on
          many AT&T machines for a long time.

          Additional C++ libraries may be available on your machine
          via official C++ library releases, and usually reside in the
          same location as your local libC.a.  These libraries are
          fully supported.  For more information, contact your system
          administrator or mozart!c++.
