          After being downloaded, the program _x_u_c_a_c_h_e will cache
          itself as a global command and exits.  The user can access
          the command through the MMMMoooorrrreeee submenu under the item _x_u_c_a_c_h_e
          displayed with a garbage can icon. An arrow from the item
          directs the user to a submenu that lists sequentially all
          objects (commands and applications) that are currently in
          the terminal's Application cache.

          The names listed in the _x_u_c_a_c_h_e submenu are the _m_e_n_u _n_a_m_e_s
          of the objects. Menu names are names that cached applica-
          tions use to advertise themselves in the MMMMoooorrrreeee menu. They may
          be different from _t_a_g _n_a_m_e_s which uniquely identify an
          object in the Application cache.  (For further discussion,
          see _6_3_0 _M_T_G _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _M_a_n_u_a_l.)  If an object in the
          Application cache does not have a menu name, its tag name is
          displayed instead.

          Items in the _x_u_c_a_c_h_e submenu may be greyed. Greyed items
          mean they cannot be selected for removal because:

          ----    they have been cached with the AAAA____PPPPEEEERRRRMMMMAAAANNNNEEEENNNNTTTT bit set [see
               _c_a_c_h_e(_3_L) in the _6_3_0 _M_T_G _S_o_f_t_w_a_r_e _R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e _M_a_n_u_a_l].
               In this case, the item names are displayed with a lock
               icon, and they can never be uncached by _x_u_c_a_c_h_e.
                                         oooorrrr

          ----    they have been requested (used) by some running pro-
               cess.  If all processes using the object exit or are
               deleted, then the item's name corresponding to the
               object will be un-greyed.

          Items that are not greyed can be selected for removal. All
          caching information concerning the object will be erased and
          the memory freed.  Note that _x_u_c_a_c_h_e can remove itself from
          the Application cache.
