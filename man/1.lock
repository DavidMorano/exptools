     NAME
	  Lock - Lock terminal

     SYNOPSIS
	  lock

     DESCRIPTION
	  Lock allows a	user to	lock his/her terminal so that the user
	  may leave the	terminal for a short while with	it still
	  logged on.  Lock uses	your login password to unlock.

     WARNING
	  Lock should NOT be used to hold a port into the system for
	  an extended time (say	over lunch). Such abuse	could result
	  in the user finding his terminal has been shipped to Outer
	  Mongolia for repairs (turn around time 19 months) by users
	  who were unable to login because there were no open ports.

     FILES
	  /etc/private
