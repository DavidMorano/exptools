          This is a slightly modified (by Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM)
          version of a TeX family program manual page from the
          official worldwide UNIXTeX distribution of the same date as
          above.  Rather than make extensive changes to it which will
          need to be integrated into new versions of this manual page
          from there or elsewhere, we exptools' TeX package providers
          maintain hints, tips, status commentaries, local bugs, and
          information on our extensions and differences from the
          standard TeX and LaTeX, METAFONT, etc.  distributions in the
          directory $TOOLS/lib/tex/tips (TOOLS=`logdir exptools`).

          Please look there for various caveats, including items
          superseding this manual page.  Running TeX/LaTeX/SLITeX
          brings you most of the way to obtaining printed output, but
          the current method to make the last necessary steps is
          discussed in the "tips" directory.

          Note there are AT&T LaTeX "documentstyles" available, and
          the exptools' docsubmit(1) command accepts the TeX family of
          languages.

          If you have any questions about TeX/LaTeX/SLITeX etc. after
          looking in our "tips" directory, or perhaps can't find our
          tips directory, you can contact us.  To find out who we, the
          exptools tex package (TeX/LaTeX/SLITeX, etc.) providers,
          currently are, use the exptools' command "providers tex".
          As of this writing we were Mark_A_Hartman@ATT.COM and
          Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM.

          LaTeX and SLITeX are versions of TeX with additional macros
          to make writing papers and slides easy, see the LaTeX book,
          reference below.

          One needn't worry about references to initex, virtex, cmmf,
          inimf, or virmf here...  See the tips directory for more
          information on them if you're interested.  Those of these
          that we make available would be located in directories
          internal to the exptools' TeX package.

          METAFONT reads the program in the specified files and
          outputs font rasters (in GF format) and font metrics (TFM
          files).  METAFONT capabilities and language are described in
          _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k by Donald E. Knuth, published by Addison
          Wesley.  There is also an older manual, _T_e_X _a_n_d _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T,
          which describes the older version of METAFONT, now called
          METAFONT-in-SAIL, but this description is now obsolete.

          Like TeX , METAFONT is normally used with a large body of
          precompiled macros.  Font generation in particular requires
          the support of several macro files.  The basic programs as
          compiled are called _i_n_i_m_f and _v_i_r_m_f, and are distinguished
          by the fact that _i_n_i_m_f can be used to precompile macros into
          a ``*.base'' file, which is used by _v_i_r_m_f. _V_i_r_m_f can read a
          precompiled ``*.base'' file, but it cannot create one.  It
          is the version of METAFONT which lies behind most font
          production systems.

          By convention, the program used to compile the Computer
          Modern fonts is called _c_m_m_f, which is essentially an alias
          for _v_i_r_m_f with the Computer Modern support macros loaded in
          as a ``base'' file.  In the following discussion, the name
          METAFONT will be used whenever the behavior of all varieties
          of the program is the same.  Otherwise, it should be assumed
          that the behavior described is unique to the program named.
          Any arguments given on the command line to one of the
          METAFONT programs, such as _c_m_m_f, are passed to them as the
          first input line.  As described in _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k, that
          line should begin with a file name or a \controlsequence.
          The normal usage is to say

               ccccmmmmmmmmffff  '\mode=<printengine>; [\mag=magstep(_n);]' input
               _f_o_n_t

          to start processing _f_o_n_t._m_f. The single quotes are the best
          way of keeping the shell from misinterpreting the semicolons
          and from removing the \ characters, which are needed here to
          keep METAFONT from thinking that you want to produce a font
          called ``mode'' or ``mag''. Other \controlsequences, such as

          \batchmode (for silent operation) can also appear. The name
          ``font'' will be the ``jobname'', and is used in forming
          output file names.  If METAFONT doesn't get a file name in
          the first line, the jobname is ``mfput''.  The default `.mf'
          extension can be overridden by specifying an extension
          explicitly.  There is no way to read a METAFONT input file
          with no filename extension.

          A log of error messages goes into  _f_o_n_t...._l_o_g where _f_o_n_t is
          the jobname. The output files are  _f_o_n_t...._t_f_m and
          _f_o_n_t....<number>_g_f where <number> depends on the resolution and
          magnification of the font.  The ``\mode'' in this example is
          shown generically as <printengine>, a symbolic term for
          which the name of an actual printengine or the name
          ``localfont'' (see below) must be substituted.  If the
          ``\mode'' is not specified or is not valid for your site,
          METAFONT will default to ``proof'' mode which produces large
          character images for use in font design and refinement.
          Proof mode can immediately be recognized by the appearance
          of the suffix ._2_6_0_2_g_f
           after the jobname.  Examples of proof mode output can be
          found in _T_h_e _C_o_m_p_u_t_e_r _M_o_d_e_r_n _T_y_p_e_f_a_c_e_s, (Volume E of

          _m_a_g_s_t_e_p_s is identical to the system used by TeX , with
          values normally in the range 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and
          5.0.  A listing of GF numbers for 118-dpi, 120-dpi, 240-dpi
          and 300-dpi fonts is shown below.

            mag=magstep(5)       294       299       597       746

          Magnification can also be specified not as a magstep but as
          an arbitrary value, such as 1.315, to create special
          character sizes.

          Before font production can begin, it is necessary to set up
          the appropriate `base' files.  The minimum set of components
          for font production for a given print-engine is the _p_l_a_i_n._m_f
          macro file and a `mode_def' file.  The macros in _p_l_a_i_n._m_f
          can be studied in an appendix to the _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k; they were
          developed by Donald Knuth, and this file should never be
          altered except when it is officially upgraded. Mode_def
          specifications are tailored to each different print-engine.
          There is a regular discussion of them in the journal of the
          TeX Users Group, _T_U_G_b_o_a_t, and models can be found in the
          file _m_o_d_e_s._m_f which is in the standard distribution of TeX

     MMMMFFFF((((1111))))                  6666////11114444////99991111 ((((EEEEXXXXPPPPTTTTOOOOOOOOLLLLSSSS))))                   MMMMFFFF((((1111))))



          for Unix systems.  All sites are strongly encouraged to use
          _m_o_d_e_s._m_f as their `mode_def' file to ensure consistency in
          the fonts generated between sites.

          With only _p_l_a_i_n._m_f and _m_o_d_e_s._m_f loaded it is possible to
          create fonts of simple characters, such as those used for
          the METAFONT logo, and those used for the LaTeX line and
          circle fonts; but the production of Computer Modern fonts
          requires that _c_m_b_a_s_e._m_f be loaded as well.  The best way to
          do this is to create a small ``driver'' file with the lines
                         input plain
                         input modes
                         input cmbase
          and name this file ccccmmmmmmmmffff....mmmmffff.  Then run _i_n_i_m_f with the
          arguments ``cmmf dump'', and you will finish up with a file
          named _c_m_m_f._b_a_s_e . The `base' file is used by _v_i_r_m_f. It needs
          to be given a base file name as the first thing it reads.  A
          base file name is preceded by an &, which needs to be quoted
          or escaped with \ if given on the command line.

          Fortunately, it is no longer necessary to make explicit
          references to the base file.  The present version of
          METAFONT, when compiled from this distribution, looks at its
          own command line to determine what name it was called under.
          It then uses that name, with the ``.base'' suffix appended,
          to search for the appropriate base file.  This is the reason
          for naming the ``driver'' file above ccccmmmmmmmmffff....mmmmffff.  You should
          probably also make up another base file using a driver named
          mmmmffff....mmmmffff, with only the _p_l_a_i_n._m_f and `mode_def' file declared.
          This will be your base file when you invoke _v_i_r_m_f with the
          name _m_f.  To make the whole thing work, it is necessary to
          link _v_i_r_m_f to all the names of base files that you have
          prepared.  Hard links will do very nicely in this instance.
          (These steps are by and large taken care of by the current
          WEB to C makefile, but it is a good idea to understand them
          for the regular use of METAFONT.)

          If you choose to preload ``cmmf'' using the ``undump''
          program you get a faster startup, but only at the price of
          lost flexibility and of large storage requirements for the
          preloaded version. WWWWAAAARRRRNNNNIIIINNNNGGGG.... Do not use a base with _c_m_b_a_s_e._m_f
          preloaded when you make up the line and circle fonts for
          LaTeX.  It causes subtle errors in the compiled font and
          makes the production of clean drawings in LaTeX picture mode
          virtually impossible.

          There are some environment variables that can be used to set
          up directory paths to search when METAFONT opens a file for
          input.  For example, the _c_s_h command
              setenv MFINPUTS .:/usr/me/mylib:$TOOLS/lib/tex/mf
          or the _s_h command sequence
              MFINPUTS=.:/usr/me/mylib:$TOOLS/lib/tex/mf

              export MFINPUTS
          would cause all invocations of METAFONT and its derivatives
          to look for \input files first in the current directory,
          then in a hypothetical user's ``mylib'', and finally in the
          system library.  Normally, the user will place the command
          sequence which sets up the MFINPUTS environment variable in
          the ._c_s_h_r_c or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file.

          The _e response to METAFONT's error-recovery mode invokes the
          system default editor at the erroneous line of the source
          file.  There is an environment variable, MFEDIT, that can be
          used to override the default editor. It should contain a
          string with "%s" indicating where the filename goes and "%d"
          indicating where the decimal linenumber (if any) goes.  For
          example, an MFEDIT string for the _v_i editor can be set with
          the _c_s_h command:
                  setenv MFEDIT "/usr/ucb/vi +%d %s"
9          (replacing the path name for the editor as appropriate on
          your system).  The environment variables section below lists
          the relevant environment variables, and their defaults.

          A convenient file in the library is _n_u_l_l._m_f, containing
          nothing.  When _m_f can't find the file it thinks you want to
          input, it keeps asking you for another file name;
          responding `null' gets you out of the loop if you don't want
          to input anything.

          Most sites need at least two families of font resolution:
          one for printing and the other for previewing. If both
          write-white and write-black printers are used at the same
          site it may even be necessary to have two sets of fonts at
          the same resolution.  When preloaded with a `mode-def' file
          (_m_o_d_e_s._m_f is recommended) METAFONT has several modes, each
          associated with a given print engine or display device. In
          regular use the mode `localfont' is made equivalent to the

          Once a METAFONT source is written, the following steps may
          be used to generate a GF file for proofing, TFM file for the
          width table, and raster font files for printing and
          previewing at each desired resolution.

                          STEP 1. Compile font
                              Input: _c_m_m_f _m_y_f_o_n_t
                              Output: myfont.2602gf, myfont.log

                          STEP 2. Generate DVI-file
                              Input: _g_f_t_o_d_v_i _m_y_f_o_n_t._2_6_0_2_g_f
                              Output: myfont.dvi, myfont.log

                          STEP 3. Produce printable output
                              (e. g. from a PostScript printer)
                              Input: _d_v_i_t_p_s _m_y_f_o_n_t | _l_p_r
                              Note: You need special black, gray and
                              slant fonts for this.

                          STEP 4. Generate generic format rastered font:
                              Input: _c_m_m_f '\_m_o_d_e=_l_o_c_a_l_f_o_n_t;
                              \_m_a_g=_m_a_g_s_t_e_p(_1._0);' _i_n_p_u_t _m_y_f_o_n_t
                              Output: myfont.360gf, myfont.tfm,
                              myfont.log
                              Note: Steps 1 through 3 are necessarily
                              only if you are working on a new design.
                              If all you need is a specific size and
                              resolution of a well-known font, then
                              only step 4 is needed.

          METAFONT can use most modern displays, so you can see its
          output without printing.  Chapter 23 of _T_h_e _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T_b_o_o_k
          describes what you can do.  This implementation of METAFONT
          uses environment variables to determine which display device
          you want to use.  First it looks for a variable MFTERM, and
          then for TERM.  If it can't find either, you get no online
          output.  Otherwise, the value of the variable determines the
          device to use: hhhhpppp2222666622227777, ssssuuuunnnn (for SunView), tttteeeekkkk, uuuunnnniiiitttteeeerrrrmmmm (for
          an Atari ST Tek 4014 emuluator), xxxxtttteeeerrrrmmmm (for either X10 or
          X11).  Some of these devices may not be supported in all
          METAFONT executables; the choice is made at compilation
          time.

          The default values for all environment variables are set at
          the time of compilation in a file called _s_i_t_e._h . See tttteeeexxxx(1)
          for the details of the searching.  If the environment
          variable TEXMFOUTPUT is set, METAFONT attempts to put its
          output files in it, if they cannot be put in the current

          METAFONT was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it
          using his WEB system for Pascal programs.  It was ported to
          Unix by Paul Richards at the University of Illinois at
          Urbana-Champaign. The version now offered with the Unix TeX
          distribution is that generated by the WEB to C system, begun
          by Tomas Rokicki and Tim Morgan, and developed and
          maintained by a team of wizards headed by Karl Berry. This
