          _t_5_4_2_5 is a 4425/5425 terminal emulator for the 630/730 MTG.
          The emulator caches itself by default and can be used with
          layers or standalone.  Use of +c will turn off default
          caching.  The emulator's version identification is displayed
          in the right side of the top label bar.  The environment
          variable TERM should be set to 5425 or equivelent (4425).
          In 132 column mode use 5425-w.


          DISPLAY

          When a new window is created (either through a download or
          from the command cache) it automatically reshapes to a fixed
          size window of 80 columns by 24 rows (with 3 extra lines for
          the message line and on-screen key labels).  Upon exit ( ESC
          [ 1 z ), the window automatically reshapes to its previous
          dimensions.  The -w option selects 132 column mode at
          startup.  If 132 column mode has been "saved" on the setup
          screen, the -n option will select 80 column mode at startup.
          The default font for _t_5_4_2_5 is built into the program and
          includes a narrow version for 132 column mode, but is
          available in the font cache as T5425 and T5425-N.  This font
          includes all of the characters for the alternate fonts: UK,
          Special and Line Drawing, Securities Industry and Mosaics.
          All of the 5425 graphic renditions are also supported: Half
          Intensity, Underscore, Blink, Reverse Video, and Blank.
          Other fonts may be used with _t_5_4_2_5 by using the -f<fontname>
          option or by selecting a new font from the font menu.  If
          132 column mode is selected, the font must be small enough
          to fit the screen.  Note that the specified font must be in
          the font cache and any characters not supplied by that font
          will be displayed as blanks.  Note also that only constant
          width fonts work correctly.  Also note that, if _t_5_4_2_5 is
          cached with the font change option on the 630, it will
          always try to use the specified font when a new window is
          created.  If this font is removed, _t_5_4_2_5 will use the
          default font.

          The -v option switches the emulation to VT102 (see below).

          630 MTG 98-key keyboard maps well to the keys of the 5425;
          the 122-key keyboard is supported, but may not be completely
          obvious, and the PC-style keyboard for the 730 MTG also is
          supported; other keyboards are not supported.  Two keys from
          each of these keyboards are used for "special" functions:
          The PRGM1 key repeats the last left keypad function used and
          the PRGM2 key reloads terminal settings in setup.  These
          keys are specically defined below for each keyboard.

          On the 98-key keyboard: The shifted function keys F1 - F8
          operate identically to the 5425 and use the familiar 3-2-3
          layout, providing access to modes and features of the
          terminal:

     +-------+------+-------+  +-------+------+  +---------+----+--------+
     |   f1  |  f2  |  f3   |  |  f4   |  f5  |  |   f6    | f7 |   f8   |
     | SETUP | DIAL | PRINT |  | MODES | MENU |  | USER PF |    | SYS PF |
     +-------+------+-------+  +-------+------+  +---------+----+--------+

          The PF1 - PF4 keys map to the F11 - F14 keys.  The Break,
          Discon, and Reset keys all work the way the same as the 5425
          versions.  The Clear and Home keys are mapped to the 5425
          left keypad keys of the same name and are otherwise
          identical.  CAPS LOCK and NO SCROLL are indicated on the
          keyboard, in the top label bar and between the on screen
          labels.  The F9 key is PRGM1 and the F10 key is PRGM2.

          On the 102-key PC-style keyboard: The F1 - F8 keys perform
          the f1 - f8 functions and are layed out as 4-4, the F9 - F12
          keys are used for the 5425 PF1 - PF4 keys.  The Insert, End,
          Page Up, and Page Down keys are mapped to Insert Char,
          Bottom, Scroll Up, and Scroll Down, respectively.  The F13
          key is PRGM1 and the F14 key is PRGM2.  The Alt and Alt
          Compose keys have no function.

          On the 122-key keyboard: The PF1 - PF8 keys perform the f1 -
          f8 functions using a non-spaced layout, while the PF21 -
          PF24 keys are used for the 5425 PF1 - PF4 keys.  The keys
          Break, Scroll Lock, Del, and Esc all act as expected.  The
          Insert Char, Insert Line, Delete Char, Delete Line, Clear
          and Home keys are mapped to the 5425 left keypad keys of the
          same name and are otherwise identical.  The Attn key is
          mapped to Here Is.  The Erase EOF is mapped to Clear Line.
          The PA1 key is PRGM1 and the PA2 key is PRGM2.  The other 18
          keys (both marked and blank) have no function.

          On the 730 the Control-Space sequence implements a screen
          swap.

          Some of the initial settings for the 5425 come from the
          630/730 environment; such as Cursor Blink, Key Click, and
          Background Color.  (The printer type at startup is set to
          normal or graphics depending on the setting of the 630/730
          "Filter Escapes" setting).  The PF Keys of the 630/730 are
          loaded into the user function key contents (shift-F6) .  All
          settings can be changed and saved from the standard setup
          screens (shift-F1).  The initial settings of the MTG
          environment can be restored as specified at the bottom of
          the set-up screens.  Saved settings are common to all copies
          of _t_5_4_2_5 and are adopted by newly created windows.

          Scrolling regions and off-screen line memory are completely
          implemented.  The emulator also provides complete VT52
          compatibility.

          The top label area of the emulator window may be progammed
          with the appropriate 630/730 escape sequence.  If a zero
          length string is sent, the label will return to the default
          version display.


          MOUSE FUNCTIONS

          Button 1 of the mouse may be used to select areas of text
          from the 24 line text region of the screen.  The selected
          text is outlined with newlines being indicated by a slight
          angulation at the end of the line.  The selection area is
          only valid until the next character is received.

          Button 2 brings up the application menu (except in the Set-
          Up screens).  Five submenus are currently implemented: Edit,
          Font, Keys, Print, and Options.  The Edit menu behaves the
          same way as the normal window proc Edit menu, except that
          only Send and Save are supported.  The Font menu allows the
          font to be changed, in 132 column mode the font must be
          narrow enough to fit on the screen.  The Keys menu provides
          a selection menu for either the Left or Right keypads of the
          5425 keyboard.  The Print menu duplicates the functions of
          the Printer screen labels, and permits the save buffer to be
          printed.  The Options menu allows the type of emulation to
          be changed between 4425/5425 and VT102 (see below).  User
          defined menus are defined identically to the 630/730
          mechanism, with the addition that, if the sequence ESC [ ?
          p1 ; p2 ; p3 y is used the sequence is handled locally,
          without being transmitted to the host.  The parameters are
          identical to those of the normal sequence.  This allows the
          definition of a "Quit" menu item by using the following
          sequence: ESC [ ? 4 ; 4 ; 0 y Q u i t ESC [ 1 z.  The
          graphical left keypad can be accessed by holding down the
          Control key or the keyboard and selecting mouse button 2.

          VT102 EMULATION

          This area is still under development, but the "basic"
          functionality is there.  The terminal type response is
          changes to that of a VT100 with Advanced Graphics.  The
          escape sequence to program function keys is replaced with
          one that changes the keyboard LEDs (under construction).
          Double wide/double high characters are not supported.


          CURRENTLY UNSUPPORTED FEATURES

               * Line and block modes and "Start Send" escape
               sequence. (Next on the list)
               * Windowing mode and Workspace/Viewport escape
               sequence.
               * The internal autodialer (shift-F2).
               * Transmit Options and Start Program Download escape
               sequences.
               * VT100 mode - double wide/double height characters.
