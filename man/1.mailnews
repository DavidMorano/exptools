	  Failure to comply with this may bring	system	administrators
	  down	on  your  head.	 It has	happened before.  Don't	let it
	  happen to you.  See the CAVEAT 1, below.

	  In the absence of options, this  command  simply  scans  the
	  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y(s)	for  new files or files	that have been changed
	  since	the last time a	 time-stamp  file  has	been  modified
	  (presumably  by the previous use of _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s).  If no	_d_i_r_e_c_-
	  _t_o_r_y is specified, it	 uses  the  value  from	 the  NNNNEEEEWWWWSSSSPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH
	  environment  variable, which may be set to a colon-separated
	  list of news directories.  If	NNNNEEEEWWWWSSSSPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH isn't set, it acts as
	  though  it  were set to ----ssss::::////uuuussssrrrr////nnnneeeewwwwssss,	which says to scan the
	  /usr/news directory, if there	is one,	otherwise  don't  com-
	  plain	(----ssss option).  (See the section on NNNNEEEEWWWWSSSSPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH, below.)

	  By default, the time-stamp file is kept in the $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE	direc-
	  tory	and  is	named ...._d_i_r_n_a_m_e____ttttiiiimmmmeeee, where _d_i_r_n_a_m_e is the base
	  portion of the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y (all	 directory  prefixes  stripped
	  off).	 Thus, the /usr/news directory files are compared with
	  $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE////....nnnneeeewwwwssss____ttttiiiimmmmeeee by default.

	  If a project keeps a bulletin	board (bbbbbbbb) directory in	 their
	  main directory (say $PROJDIR), then using the	command

	      mailnews $PROJDIR/bb

	  causes it to scan  the  $PROJDIR/bb  directory  looking  for
	  files	 that  have changed since $HOME/.bb_time was modified,
	  presumably by	the previous use of _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s.  Files that can-
	  not  be read are reported in a separate mail message,	unless
	  the ----qqqq option	is given.  They	have no	 effect	 on  the  exit
	  code.

	  The ----ffff option	may be used to specify the name	of a different
	  time-stamp  file (to avoid collisions, for example), for the
	  next specified _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y.   However,	any  command  line  ----ffff
	  option  is  ignored  and  a warning message is printed if no

	  _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is specified on the	command	line.  See the section
	  on OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss, below.

	  By default, files whose names	begin with a dot are  ignored,
	  unless  the  ----dddd  option  is  used.  The ----DDDD option causes the
	  default behavior of  ignoring	 dot  files.   Both  of	 these
	  options,  like  the ----ffff option, may be	intermixed with	_d_i_r_e_c_-
	  _t_o_r_y arguments.

	  Each file newer than the time-stamp file is  directed	 to  a
	  separate _m_a_i_l(1) message with	a preceding Subject: line that
	  identifies the name of the file, and the _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y  name  of
	  the  file.  It also adds a Posted: heading that includes the
	  date and time	that the file was last modified, in  the  form
	  yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss, and It adds a
	     From: (News from _o_w_n_e_r)
	  line before the Subject: line	so that	the message looks like
	  it  came  from a user	named  NNNNeeeewwwwssss ffffrrrroooommmm _o_w_n_e_r,	where _o_w_n_e_r is
	  the login that owns the news file (probably  whoever	posted
	  the  news  item).  These heading lines are especially	useful
	  for identifying messages in _m_a_i_l_x or _p_o_s_t.

	  The files are	mailed in the order that they were last	 modi-
	  fied,	from oldest to newest.	Users of the vanilla _m_a_i_l com-
	  mand may wish	to  use	 its  ----rrrr  option  to  force  first-in,
	  first-out  order  when  reading these	messages.  Better yet,
	  use _m_a_i_l_x or _p_o_s_t if your system has them.

	  You can have _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s	exclude	pesky repeat news  item	 files
	  that	you don't care about.  To do so, place each name, or a
	  file name pattern that matches the name, 1 per  line,	 in  a
	  file	named  ....ddddoooonnnnttttmmmmaaaaiiiillll  in  your  HOME  directory, or	in the
	  directory specified by the DDDDOOOOTTTTDDDDIIIIRRRR environment	 variable  (if
	  you choose to	set it and export it).

	  Also,	a name or filename pattern that	begins with <<<< means to
	  exclude  items from the user whose login name	follows	the <<<<.
	  For example, <<<<wwwwooooooooddddssss would cause _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s to ignore  my  news
	  items	 (bad idea).  In the case where	an article was submit-
	  ted by someone no longer listed in  /etc/passwd,  the	 login
	  "name"  is  given as #### followed by the user ID number	(as in
	  ####55555555666600000000).

	  This _e_x_c_e_p_t_i_o_n _l_i_s_t file must	not be larger than  4K	(4096)
	  bytes.   Note	 that  ???? and **** match slashes (////) and a leading
	  dot (....) in these exception list patterns, unlike  when  used
	  with the shell.

	  Patterns in the exception list are compared twice or	thrice
	  for each news	item file.  A file is ignored if its base name
	  matches an exception list  pattern,  or  if  its  full  name

	  you can make sure  it	 only  skips  unwanted	items  from  a

	  ----nnnn  No touch.	 This option disables the normal  touching  of

	  ----qqqq  Causes it	to be quiet about files	that are not  readable

	  1.  Due to past abuses of _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s, in which	a  few	people
	      made  a  lot of people suffer, _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s gives up sending
	      files after having sent 30 files or 30,000 bytes,	which-
	      ever  comes  first.  If you didn't abuse _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s	and it
	      reached these limits, please note	that skipped files can
	      be  sent	on  the	 next  use  of _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s.  They are not
	      "lost."

	  2.  The time-stamp file does _n_o_t indicate that you have read
	      all news items up	to the time _m_a_i_l_n_e_w_s was invoked.  Nor
	      does it mean that	 you  have  read  all  news  items  up
	      through the latest posted.  Instead, the time-stamp file
	      indicates	that you have read all news items  up  to  the
	      latest item _t_h_a_t _y_o_u _c_a_r_e_d _t_o _r_e_a_d (non-excepted).
