	  _2_p_r is a version of the _p_r command designed for use with
	  devices that produce output on both sides of a sheet of
	  paper.  It prints the	named files on the standard output.
	  If _f_i_l_e is ----,	or if no files are specified, the standard
	  input	is assumed.  By	default, the listing is	separated into
	  pages, each headed by	the page number, a date	and time, and
	  the name of the file.	 Each file begins on a odd numbered
	  page,	i.e. each file will start on the front of a page of
	  paper	and no files will be printed back to back.

	  _2_p_r takes the	same options as	_p_r, with the following
	  additions:

	  ----_Pnnnn  Print files so they begin on _n page boundaries.	The
	       default for _n is	2.  If _n is 1, _2_p_r works like _p_r.
	       Another use of this option is in	the command
	       2222pppprrrr ----PPPP4444 _f_i_l_e |||| oooopppprrrr ----2222 ----pppp	2222oooonnnn1111.

	  ----_T   Do not print header or trailer lines on each page, but
	       DO print	newlines or form feeds after each file to
	       position	the print head at the next 2 (or _n) page
	       boundary.

	  Like _p_r, the output of _2_p_r is	sent to	standard output, which
	  may be associated with a terminal.  If the standard output
	  is associated	with a terminal, error messages	are withheld
	  until	_2_p_r has	completed printing.
