	  _I_c_o_n_i_z_e provides its user the	ability	to manipulate windows
	  on the DMD5620, 630 and 730 terminals	with icons.  Icons are
	  small	entities symbolizing larger ones.  When	_i_c_o_n_i_z_e	starts
	  up, it examines the currently	active processes.  It places
	  all processes	with layers windows into a list	of "known
	  processes".  This list is made up of names in	boxes, one per
	  window/layer (the icons).

	  An appropriate name for each window/layer is chosen based on
	  the information available.  Processes	which can not be
	  reshaped are initialially hidden, but	can be exposed via the
	  KKKKnnnnoooowwww menu selection which is described below.	 When shown,
	  they have a border around their associated box to signify
	  the fact that	the process is not reshapeable.

	  Each window's	name is	based on whether the window is local,
	  and whether the window is a windowproc window.  If the
	  window is a windowproc window, two naming strategies exist.
	  If the window	has a "label line", that text will always be
	  the first choice for the label (lines	longer than the	set
	  number of characters will be truncated to that length).  If
	  no label text	has been set, the name LLLLaaaayyyyeeeerrrr, will be chosen.
	  Any non-local	window will always have	its xt-channel number
	  displayed with its name.

	  The _x_t channel number	associated with	the layer will be
	  displayed to the left	of the label chosen, and all labels
	  will be right	justified.  For	example, the label for a
	  normal layer will appear as shown below.

				  ___________
				 ||_c____L_a_y_e_r__||

	  cccc is the channel number.

	  If the window	is not a windowproc window, the	basename of
	  the image that was downloaded	will be	used as	the label.
	  Any extension	....mmmm, ....nnnn,	....jjjjxxxx, ....666633330000 or ....jjjjxxxxnnnn will be removed.
	  For example, the program /somepath/dmdlock.m will have the
	  label	ddddmmmmddddlllloooocccckkkk.  A program like ddddmmmmddddppppssss,	that is	not local,
	  will have a label as shown below.

	  The cccc	is replaced with the appropriate value for the channel
	  that the window is associated	with.

	  The labels are arranged in _i_c_o_n_i_z_e'_s window in a vertical
	  (horizontal if the -hori command line	option is used)	list.
	  Iconize'd windows are	accessed by first making the _i_c_o_n_i_z_e
	  window current.  The windows are sorted according to the
	  port they are	associated with.  Local	layers are grouped
	  together.  Each group	is separated by	the other using	a box
	  which	contains the name of the port that the group is
	  associated with.  The	horizontal format is sorted from left
	  to right.  A sample _i_c_o_n_i_z_e window on	the 730	might look
	  like the following (the 630 looks similar except for the
	  port names)

	  Once the _i_c_o_n_i_z_e window is current, the mouse	pointer	is
	  used to select the windows, by pointing at the label (think
	  of the window	as a normal menu, even though it is not).  As
	  the mouse cursor moves into the rectangle that the label is
	  contained in,	one of two things happens.

	  If a window is hidden	(it is shrunk behind the _i_c_o_n_i_z_e
	  window), it will be redrawn in its previous position for
	  viewing.  If the window is not hidden, it will be placed on
	  top of all windows, except the _i_c_o_n_i_z_e window.

	  When the cursor moves	from the label rectangle, the window
	  is hidden again if it	previously was.	 If a window was not
	  hidden, nothing happens to that window as the	cursor leaves
	  its label rectangle.

	  A window is moved from the hidden state by depressing
	  button-1 while pointing at its label.	 If the	window is not
	  hidden, depressing button-1 will hide	the window.  So,
	  button-1 provides a toggle to	hide or	display	any of the
	  windows that _i_c_o_n_i_z_e has in its list.	 When _i_c_o_n_i_z_e is on a

	  Depressing button-2 always causes the	window associated with

	  Some selections are greyed when they are not applicable due

	       _i_c_o_n_i_z_e to ignore the window label on a 630/730 wwwwpppprrrroooocccc

	       changed to alter	how _i_c_o_n_i_z_e behaves while in use.  The
	       options are either on or	off settings.  The activation
	       is indicated in the menu	by the presence	of a checkmark
	       next to the option name.	 Non-active options have
	       circles with slashes drawn through them,	next to	the
	       associated option.

	       The options and their associated	actions	are:

	  NNNNoooo llllaaaabbbbeeeellllssss	 This option causes _i_c_o_n_i_z_e to hide the	llllaaaabbbbeeeellllssss

	  DDDDeeeeaaaacccctttt		 Selecting this	option causes all future

			 determines whether or not _i_c_o_n_i_z_e follows the
			 screen	swapper	(730 only) when	a new screen
			 is selected.  When this option	is on, the
			 checkmark is displayed	beside the selection,
			 _i_c_o_n_i_z_e will notice that the screen that it
			 is mapped to is no longer the current screen
			 and switch to it.  The	sub menu appears as

			 Selecting either item will allow you to

	  o	  The SSSSiiiizzzzeeee selection produces a	submenu	which is not

		  and their difference (the size of the	layer).


	  o	  The IIIIggggnnnnoooorrrreeee selection causes the layer	corresponding
		  to the label that the	mouse arrow was	pointing at to
		  be "ignored" by _i_c_o_n_i_z_e.  While _i_c_o_n_i_z_e is ignoring
		  a layer, it does not display the label for that
		  layer.  By default, all non-reshapable layers	are
		  "ignored" when they are first	discovered.  The KKKKnnnnoooowwww
		  selection allows them	to be displayed	in the list

	  o	  The KKKKnnnnoooowwww ---->>>> selection	is used	to remove layers from
		  the "ignored"	list.  The menu	is generated based on
		  the layers which are currently being ignored.	 This

		  ignored.


	  o	  The SSSSwwwwaaaapppp ---->>>> selection	is used	to tell	_i_c_o_n_i_z_e	to
		  swap the layer, that the mouse arrow was pointing
		  at, to a particular screen.  Selecting SSSSwwwwaaaapppp without

		  This menu provides access to the screen swapper
		  primatives.  CCCCrrrreeeeaaaatttteeee will create a new	virtual	screen
		  that can have	windows	created	on it.	The windows
		  remain associated with this screen until they	are
		  moved	or move	themselves to a	different screen.  The
		  CTRL-space keystroke switches	between	screens.
		  Alternatively, the NNNNeeeexxxxtttt and PPPPrrrreeeevvvviiiioooouuuussss menu selections
		  above	will switch to the next	or previous screen.
		  The DDDDeeeelllleeeetttteeee selection removes a virtual screen.  The
		  DDDDeeeelllleeeetttteeee option	requires that there be no windows on
		  the current screen, which _i_c_o_n_i_z_e can	not swap to
		  another screen, when it is selected.	The PPPPuuuusssshhhh
		  selection causes the mouse pointer to	change to the
		  target, selection icon.  Clicking on a layer with
		  button 3 will	cause that layer to be pushed to the
		  next screen.

		  The FFFFoooolllllllloooowwww---->>>>SSSSwwwwaaaappppppppeeeerrrr option should be selected	when

		  selected, _i_c_o_n_i_z_e will move itself to	the next
		  screen before	attempting to delete the requested
		  screen.  If a	bell sounds when one of	these
		  functions is selected, the underlying	terminal
		  primative failed for some reason, probably because a
		  layer	was left on the	screen and _I_c_o_n_i_z_e was not
		  told to swap it.

	  _I_c_o_n_i_z_e keeps	an eye on the windows that it is manipulating.
	  It checks periodically to see	if the associated processes
	  are still active.  Those that	are not, it removes from its
	  list.	 Any newly created windows/layers are automatically
	  added	to the list.  Periodically it checks for changes in
	  the names of the processes running in	each window.  While a
	  process is loading, the name may not be set correctly.  Once
	  the process is finished loading, more	information is
	  available to select the proper name.	Local editing windows

	  When selecting a menu	item which will	require	you to type
	  information to _i_c_o_n_i_z_e, the layer is reshaped	into a long
	  rectangle in the middle of the terminal screen.  A prompt is
	  issued that describes	the desired information.  After	the
	  return key is	typed, _i_c_o_n_i_z_e will return to its previous
	  place	and take action	on the typed data.

	  On the 730 terminal, when _i_c_o_n_i_z_e is reloaded	from the
	  cache, any specified parameters will be passed to the	copy
	  that is already running.  E.g.

		   iiiiccccoooonnnniiiizzzzeeee ----nnnnoooollllaaaabbbbeeeellllssss

	  will start up	_i_c_o_n_i_z_e	(from the cache) and send the
	  ----nnnnoooollllaaaabbbbeeeellllssss argument to	the copy already running.

	  Some parameters take effect immediately while	others (e.g.
	  -labels) won't take effect until after _i_c_o_n_i_z_e is made the
	  current layer.  The communication method is through a	shared
	  message queue	which may be documented	in the future.

     CCCCAAAAVVVVEEEEAAAATTTTSSSS
	  When a layer is first	discovered, if it is marked as
	  NONRESHAPABLE, _i_c_o_n_i_z_e will IIIIggggnnnnoooorrrreeee it	automatically.	This
	  may sometimes	cause confusion	as to where a layer's label
	  is.  This is a result	of the process structure not being
	  fully	initialized at the time	that the process is inserted
	  into the process list	that _i_c_o_n_i_z_e looks at.

	  _I_c_o_n_i_z_e makes	use of some undocumented procedures to keep
	  track	of processes.  Namely, the design of the PPPPrrrroooocccc and
	  LLLLaaaayyyyeeeerrrr	structures.

	  When the DDDDeeeeaaaacccctttt option	is used, the deactivated layer process
	  does not process characters from the host.  This means that
	  output from the host could eventually	cause the host
	  process(es) to be put	to sleep because of output blocking by
	  the xt devices.  This	can result in resource shortages on
	  the host if done for extended	periods	of time.

	  Sometimes _i_c_o_n_i_z_e makes the wrong guess for the name of a
	  layer.  Generally this is during the down-loading process.
	  You may explicitly have to rename the	layer.	Due to
	  inconsistancies in the process data structures, during
	  down-loading,	this behavior is not easily corrected.

	  When a new process is	loaded into a layer, _i_c_o_n_i_z_e ignores
	  previous, explict renaming, and selects a new	name using the
	  previously outlined procedures.

	  Because _i_c_o_n_i_z_e is competing with the	terminal control
	  process for information about	the mouse cursor, and its
	  current "picture", the mouse cursor may sometimes be wrong.
	  Moving the mouse around, and/or out of the current layer and
	  back usually restores	the correct cursor.

	  The 730 corrects several problems that exist in the 630.  In
	  particular, the reason the -setlab option is not available
	  on the 630 is	due to a problem with caching.

	  The SSSSwwwwaaaapppp ---->>>> option can not be	used to	control	_i_c_o_n_i_z_e
