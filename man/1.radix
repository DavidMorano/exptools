            Radix decision tracing commands allow authors to write
            documents in a format that will facilitate requirements
            traceability. The commands are n/troff based and work
            in conjunction with the Memorandum Macros (MM). Radix
            commands allow decisions (requirements) in a document
            to be broken down into partitioned units of
            information. When the document is printed, the
            decisions will be highlighted (printed in bold), aiding
            reviewers in focusing on critical information.
            Additionally, facilities are provided for printing
            summary reports of the decisions.

            The rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx command prepares an mm document containing
            radix commands for formatting with nroff/troff. rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx
            prints the result to the standard output. If no
            arguments are given, the standard input is assumed to
            contain the file to be processed.

            There are two implementations of the rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx command. One
            implementation is a preprocessor, similar to pic or
            tbl. The other implementation  is a macro package,
            similar to the MM macros. Users may select which
            implementation to use via command line flags. The
            preprocessor is the default implementation. The macros
            are being phased out and receive only limited support.

            No conversion is necessary to use the preprocessor on
            documents that were previously formatted with the
            macros. However, the two implementations have different
            restrictions and some minor behavioral differences. See
            RRRREEEESSSSTTTTRRRRIIIICCCCTTTTIIIIOOOONNNNSSSS and EEEEXXXXTTTTEEEENNNNDDDDEEEEDDDD DDDDEEEESSSSCCCCRRRRIIIIPPPPTTTTIIIIOOOONNNN for details.

            There are three ways to use the rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx command:

              1.  Use the preprocessor implementation. This is the
                  default, and is the recommended way to  use



       Page 1                              (printed 11/13/90)

                  rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx. Its use is similar to pic or tbl (see
                  "EEEEXXXXAAAAMMMMPPPPLLLLEEEESSSS"). Previous versions of rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx required
                  a "-p" flag to get the preprocessor. The "-p"
                  flag is no longer required, although it won't
                  hurt anything if it is there.

              2.  Use the macro implementation each time the memo
                  is formatted. This use  is identical to method 1,
                  above, except for the presence of the "-m" flag.

              3.  Use the macro implementation as a "one-shot"
                  processor. Previous releases of rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx also
                  allowed the command to  produce a new sourcefile,
                  after which it was no longer necessary to use the
                  rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx command. This will still work if "-m" is
                  specified; however, it is strongly  discouraged
                  as it can tie the document to the macro
                  implementation, which receives only limited
                  support.

            The benefits of the preprocessor are:

               - The formatting job will run approximately 10 times
                 faster (wall clock time).

               - Many bugs and restrictions in the macro
                 implementation will be eliminated.

               - Better error checking/reporting will be provided
                 by the preprocessor.

               - The preprocessor is the supported version of
                 rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx. It receives bug-fixes and enhancements.

               - Less chance of naming conflicts with troff
                 register, macro, and string names.

            If your document defines n/troff strings, registers, or
            macros, you must use care in selecting their names. To
            prevent name collisions with the rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx preprocessor, do
            not use names of the form:

                              1st char   2nd char

                              "d"        [A-Z]
                              "g"        [A-Z]
                              "r"        [A-Z]

            The preprocesssor does not expand ".so" commands in the
            source file. Use ssssooooeeeexxxxppppaaaannnndddd and pipe the output into the
            preprocessor if the "sofiles" contain:

               - radix commands

               - MM commands related to section headers (".H",
                 ".HU", or setting of the number registers "H[1-7]"
                 or "Hu", via the troff ".nr" command.)

            If you put a reference (using ".RS" and ".RF") inside
            of a radix decision, AND you use either the ".dL" or
            ".dP" summary reports, an extra entry in the reference
            table will be generated by the reprint of the decision
            text in the summary report. A solution is to put the
            ".RS" and ".RF" outside of the decision, using the
            following format:

            (The string "xX" could be any valid troff string name)

            If you put a footnote inside a radix decision, a
            footnote will appear at the bottom of the page where
            the decision originally prints, as expected. If you use
            the ".dL" or ".dP" summary reports, the footnote will
            also appear at the bottom of the page in the summary
            report where the decision text is reprinted.

            If you use the .dT command in your document, it will be
            necessary to include tbl in the pipeline that processes
            the document (only necessary if you are constructing
            your own pipeline, rather than using a general-purpose
            formatter, such as pppprrrrttttffffmmmmtttt, rrrruuuunnnnooooffffffff, or mmmmmmmmxxxx.)

            With the macro implementation, it was possible for
            users to change the output format of radix decisions by
            redefining the ".dU" macro. This is not possible with
            the preprocessor implementation.

            If your document has either the .dL or .dP command in
            it, caution must be used when renaming the file. If the
            file is renamed and the argument to the .dL or .dP
            command (which is the name of the file) is not updated,
            (sometimes subtly) erroneous output will occur.

            If you put a ".ig" around rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx decisions in your memo,
            the .dP command will produce subtly erroneous output.

            The macro implementation does not support the ".gO"
            command. See EEEEXXXXTTTTEEEENNNNDDDDEEEEDDDD DDDDEEEESSSSCCCCRRRRIIIIPPPPTTTTIIIIOOOONNNN for details.

            The preprocessor provides functionality that, as nearly
            as possible, mimics the behavior of the macros. Some
            enhancements have been provided. The differences in
            behavior between the macros and the preprocessor are as
            follows:

               - The preprocessor does not put page numbers on the
                 .dT and .dP reports. Sections numbers are
                 provided, however.

               - The .dL and .dP commands no longer require that
                 the name of the mm sourcefile be included as a
                 parameter. If this parameter is present, it
                 ignored by the preprocessor.

               - The preprocessor allows the use of ".ig" to
                 comment out sections of the document containing
                 rrrraaaaddddiiiixxxx commands.

               - The preprocessor does much more detailed error
                 checking than the macros do. The preprocessor
                 checks for two classes of problems:

                 errors:  serious problems for which there is no
                          way to generate meaningful output. Errors
                          are printed to stderr and stdout, so that
                          they will appear in the document.

                 warnings: things that may be correct, but are
                          unusual or potentially dangerous. Often,
                          a warning indicates that the preprocessor
                          is having to make assumptions as to what
                          the user wants done. The warning messages
                          are only printed to stderr, and do not
                          appear in the document.

               - The reserved set of string/register names used by
                 the preprocessor is much smaller than that used by
                 the macros (see RRRREEEESSSSTTTTRRRRIIIICCCCTTTTIIIIOOOONNNNSSSS).

               - The preprocessor flags decisions having duplicate
                 labels in the document, as well as to stderr.

               - If you give a ".gC", ".gI", ".gK", or ".gP"
                 command with no arguments, the preprocessor will
                 unset the global clusters, initials, keywords, or
                 prefix.

               - If you give a ".gD" command with no arguments, the
                 preprocessor will unset both  the global document
                 ID (1st arg), and the global "referenced document"
                 (2nd arg).

               - If you give a ".dC" or "dK" command with no
                 arguments, the preprocessor will  unset the global
                 clusters or keywords for the current decision
                 only.

               - If you put troff strings in as part of a radix
                 argument (e.g. "\*(vK"), subtle behavioral
                 differences may occur. For example, if you put a
                 string, such as "\*(vK" into the "label" field a
                 radix ".dS" command, the order that the labels
                 will be sorted into in the radix ".dT" summary
                 report will not be what is expected. This is
                 because the preprocessor has no way of knowing in
                 advance what value troff will assign to a string.

               - Certain characters are meaningless or harmful in a
                 radix argument, and will  cause an error message.
                 These are:

             \b, \c, \D, \h, \k, \l, \L, \p, \v, \{, \}, \$

               - The behavior of the .gF command has been modified
                 as follows:

                    +o All fields of the .gF command are now
                      optional.

                    +o a ".gF" with no arguments restores the field
                      separators to their default values.

                    +o The string "\&" may be used to set output
                      field separators to an empty string. (May not
                      be used for input field separators.)

                    +o a null argument to .gF may be used to leave
                      that field separator unchanged, except in the
                      case of no arguments, which restores the
                      field separators to their default values.

               - An enhancement has been made to the preprocessor
                 to provide two new output styles, the "paragraph"
                 output style and the "superscript" output style.
                 These output styles predominantly affect how
                 decisions appear in the main text of the document.
                 There are also some differences in the format of
                 the ".dP" summary report, as noted below.

                 The "paragraph" style causes the radix decisions
                 to appear as paragraphs in the main body of the
                 document. There are no markings to indicate that
                 the text you are seeing is a radix decision. Also,
                 if the "paragraph" style is selected, the ".dP"
                 summary report will have the following changes:

                    +o The document id and version will be omitted
                      from the decision tag. Only the "label" field
                      is printed in the tag.

                    +o The references (".dR"'s) for the decision
                      will be omitted.

                    +o The decision text will be printed in the
                      Roman font.

                 The "superscript" output style causes the radix
                 decisions to appear as ordinary text in the memo,
                 with a small superscript containing the decision
                 label appearing at the beginning of the decision.
                 A "box" character is printed at the end of the
                 main text of the decision. (If a decision has
                 explanatory text, it will appear after the box.)
                 Decisions formatted in this style do not cause a
                 font change or a new paragraph. Thus it is
                 possible to put more than one decision in the same
                 paragraph using this style. Also, if the
                 "superscript" style is selected, the ".dP" summary
                 report will have the following changes:

                    +o The standard ".dP" report prints the document
                      ID, label, and the version of the decision.
                      With the "superscript" style, the prefix is
                      also printed in the decision tag.

                    +o The references (".dR"'s) for the decision
                      will be omitted.

                    +o The decision text will be printed in the
                      Roman font.

                 The ".gO" ("global options") command is used to
                 select the desired output style. To choose the
