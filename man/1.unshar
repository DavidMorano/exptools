          _U_n_s_h_a_r removes mail and news header lines  from  its  input,
          and  feeds  the  remainder  to  /_b_i_n/_s_h(1)  so  that a shell
          archive  can  be  properly  unpacked.   If  no   files   are
          specified, _u_n_s_h_a_r reads from standard input.  The program is
          designed to be useful when unpacking archives directly  from
          the news or mail systems (e.g., s | unshar).

          _U_n_s_h_a_r normally unpacks its files in the current  directory.
          Use  the  ``-c''  option to have the program change to a new
          directory before invoking the shell.  If the directory  does
          not  exist,  _u_n_s_h_a_r will try to create it.  If the directory
          name starts with a question mark, then _u_n_s_h_a_r will  ask  for
          the  directory  name  before  doing  anything;  this is most
          useful with the environment  variable  UNSHAREDIR.   If  the
          directory  name  starts  with a tilde, then the value of the
          HOME environment variable  is  inserted  in  place  of  that
          character.   For convenience, the ``-d'' option is a synonym
          for the ``-c'' option.

          _U_n_s_h_a_r normally complains if the input looks like  something
          other  than a shar file.  (Among other things, it checks for
          files that resemble C, and Pascal code).  It can be  fooled,
          however,  by  nonstandard versions of news, notes, etc.  The
          ``-f'' option forces _u_n_s_h_a_r to try unpacking files, even  if
          they look like something else.

          Depending on how the program is installed, _u_n_s_h_a_r may or may
          not try to preserve the header part of file ``foo'' into the
          name ``foo.hdr'' (if the file is standard  input,  the  name
          will be ``UNSHAR.HDR'').  Using the ``-s'' option forces the
          program to save the headers, while using the  ``-n''  option
          forces  it to discard the headers.  The file is appended to,
          if it already exists, so all headers can be easily saved  in
          one  file.   The  name of the file may be given by using the
          ``-h'' option; this is particularly useful  when  processing
          more than one file at a time.

          The ``-v'' option prints out the current version and exits.

          [This same note is appended to  all  exptools  shar  package
          programs.]

          This version of the "shar" tool set is written by Rich  Salz
          (rsalz@bbn.com  or  rsalz@uunet.uu.net).   Currently  I have
          only placed shar and unshar in exptools, but  perhaps  we'll
          add one or two more of Rich's shar tools later.

          A previous version of  shar  had  an  upper  limit  on  some
          systems  on  how many files one could archive... I hope this
          bug is gone...

          I researched the competing versions of shar before  settling
          on  Rich's.  Though it might not flashy as the other leading
          brands, it is tastefully stable, etc.

          If there are any problems, contact the exptools shar package
          providers.  Use the exptools "providers" command to find out
          who we currently are.  (As  of  1990  November  14  we  were
          Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM and Russell_B_Jorgensen@ATT.COM).
