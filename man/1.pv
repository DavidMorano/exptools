	    processing program.	 It prompts you	for the	data you want to
	    put	on the form, and generates a _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t	output file
	    which it then prints on a designated _P_o_s_t_S_c_r_i_p_t compatible
	    printer.  Personal data is stored into a setup file; you
	    will only be prompted again	for the	information if an error
	    is found in	the setup file,	or if you use the -s option.

	    in the setup file as possible, but it can't	check every-
	    thing.  On the UNIX	system,	pppphhhhoooonnnneeeevvvvoooouuuucccchhhh will	use the	ppppqqqq pro-

	    setup file as possible.

	    In summary,	it fills out the form, and draws it onto a blank
	    8.5x11" paper, suitable for	signatures.

	    It does the	addition and will compute the tax amounts for
	    you, if you	tell it	what your tax rates are.

	    The	_n_a_m_e parameter is useful in letting one	person (ie: a
	    secretary) produce phone vouchers for more than one	person.
	    The	string you use for the optional	_n_a_m_e is	arbitrary, but
	    you	are limited to a maximum length	of 8 characters	on UNIX,
	    or 3 characters if you are running this on PostScript
	    printer equipped MS-DOS machine (PC).

	    Specifying the -_i option will print	the instructions found
	    on the back	of form	ATT363.

	    Specifying the -_s option allows you	to reinitialize	your
	    setup file.	 The current values are	presented as defaults.

	    The	-_b option permits you to specify the telephone billing
	    date on the	command	line.

	    Specifying the -_p option reprints an existing voucher
	    without prompting for confirmation.

	    Specifying the -_v option prints out	(on stderr) all	of the
	    calculations performed by _p_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h while generating the
	    numbers to be printed.  The	-_o option may be used with this
	    to redirect	stderr to a file.  (This is particularly useful
	    on MS-DOS machines.)

	    If you wish, you can tell _p_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h your inter-LATA and
	    intra-LATA tax rates, and it will include them in its calcu-
	    lations where appropriate.	The only reliable source (such
	    as it is) at this time for this information	is your	local
	    Telephone Company.	Separate tax figures may be specified
	    for	your federal, state and	local tax rates.  As of	this
	    writing, the Federal Inter-LATA tax	rate is	3.0%.

	    If you have	other approved business	charges, such as for a
	    home data line, the	tax rate used for those	calculations may
	    be different from the intra-LATA tax rate.	The tax	rate for
	    these charges will be prompted for separately from the
	    intra-LATA tax rate.

	    Some locations have	a variety of taxes to deal with, with
	    varying amounts based on where phone calls are placed to or
	    from or types of calls, or even post-tax surcharges.  For
	    these locations, it	is best	to use tax rates of 0.	You will
	    then be prompted for the charged taxes separately, and the
	    ratio method will be used to calculate the taxes eligible
	    for	refund.	 The prompts indicate which values require you
	    to add in the taxes.

	    If you have	a few phone calls which	are not	taxed, but the
	    rest are, then you may not be able to use the built	in cal-
	    culation capabilities of _p_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h.  (If necessary, the
	    postscript file can	be edited by hand and reprinted.)

	    Whenever a dollar figure is	requested, you may put a plus or
	    minus sign at the end of the line.	_P_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h will	then
	    prompt for an additional figure which will be added	to or
	    subtracted from, as	appropriate, the number.  This allows
	    you	to enter individual phone calls	(say business calls) and
	    let	_p_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h add them up for you.

	    If this is your first use of _p_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h, it	will then prompt
	    you	for some one-time personal information (name, address,
	    telephone number, etc), to put in your _s_e_t_u_p file before
	    proceeding.	 (After	prompting for some of the information,
	    the	post database will be queried to gather	defaults for
	    some of the	other information.)  Once your _s_e_t_u_p file is
	    established, _p_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h prompts you	for the	billing	date,
	    amount and other per-month information.  If	you wish, you
	    can	enter a	simple CCCCRRRR (carriage return) for	fields and
	    amounts you	wish to	enter zero for.	 For most phone	vouch-
	    ers, you only need to supply the billing date and amount,

	    The	forms still need to be signed.	This is	technically cur-

	    You	probably need to read the manual page to understand how
	    to use the tax rate	feature, and how to fill out vouchers
	    for	another	person.	 Unless	you are	doing one of these,
	    reading the	manual page is harder than using the program and
	    letting it prompt you for the information it needs.

	    _P_h_o_n_e_v_o_u_c_h only works with PostScript-compatible printers.
	    It has been	tested with PostScript printers	by Apple, HP,
	    NEC, and QMS, and is not known to fail with	any model.  It
	    has	also been successfully tested with the ``psi''
	    PostScript Interpreter for UNIX, and the ``GoScript''
	    PostScript emulation package for MS-DOS.
