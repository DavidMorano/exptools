          Manual is a utility providing quick access to manual pages
          for viewing them online.  Its main features are: it covers a
          diverse range of manual pages, it is fast and it allows
          matching with wildcards (useful if you do not remember the
          full name).

          From the main screen of manual you can enter the following
          commands:

          <<<<ssssttttrrrriiiinnnngggg>>>>
                  Enter an alphanumeric string and manual will start a
                  search for manual pages matching that name.  Use the
                  asterisk as a wildcard (similar to the shell), for
                  example str*py.

          <<<<nnnnuuuummmmbbbbeeeerrrr>>>>
                  After a search, enter the item's number to display
                  the manual page for that item.  If your search needs
                  to start with a digit, prefix the digit with a
                  backslash.

          SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE   will page to the next page of entries in the
                  display.

                  This allows you to create databases of the local
                  tools on your system and share the database with
                  other users.  For information on creating your own
                  database see below.

          Manual supports a general list of documentation, covering
          standard UNIX documentation, as covered by man(1), plus a
          set of the most common AT&T tool sets, such as EXPTOOLS,
          POST, UNISON etc.  See the help option of manual for a
          fuller list.

          Manual provides support of _g_e_n_e_r_i_c tools, that is tools
          which are found on a large number of AT&T UNIX machines.
          Manual does not support local tool sets, those that are
          unique to particular AT&T sites or projects.

          Although manual has a fairly comprehensive database of
          manual page locations, it may not include all the manuals
          that you need, perhaps of tools local to your system, or
          your own login.  By creating a file in your home directory,
          you can direct manual to search in additional places for
          manual pages.

          In your home directory create a file called ....mmmmaaaannnnuuuuaaaallll and in
          the file create a list of one lines entries in the following
          format:

             <directory_path>   <format>

          The directory path is the name of a directory where the
          manual pages are located (not the manual page files: the
          directory they are contained in).

          The format is a single character which tells manual what
          format those manuals are stored in.  This enables manual to
          decide how the manual pages are displayed to you.  Permitted
          values for format are:

           N   nroff file
           C   cat'able file
           Z   compressed cat'able file
           P   unix pack'ed cat'able file


          A tilde (~) can be used in the directory path to refer to a
          login directory, eg. ~username/man.

          For example, a $HOME/.manual file could be like:

           ~smith/tools/man/u_man/man1  N
           ~jones/man    C
           ~news/man     C

          If the manuals you want to reference are in a tree structure
          of directories it is not necessary to list each directory

          individually.  If the manuals are all of the same type they
          can be referenced with the top of the directory structure.
          For example, instead of:

           ~smith/tools/man/u_man/man1  N
           ~smith/tools/man/u_man/man2  N
           ~smith/tools/man/u_man/man3  N

          you can abbreviate this to

           ~smith/tools/man/u_man       N

          which will extract manuals for every subdirectory under
          u_man.  All manuals in that directory structure _m_u_s_t be of
          the same type, and there must be no non-manual files in the
          directory structure.

          Manual skips over invalid entries in the database file
          without reporting errors, so if you code the entries in your
          .manual file incorrectly, you will not get any error mes-
          sages, you will simply not be able to find manuals in those
          locations.

          As an alternative to creating a .manual file in your home
          directory, you can create your additional database in any
          filename and use the -d option to link it to manual.  This
          also allows you to share your database file with other
          users.

          You can only retrieve a maximum of 100 entries from one
          search.  Manual will notify you it has reached that limit by
          showing you the number of retrieved entries as 100+.  Use a
          more precise search pattern.

          Manual will only correctly match entries where the file name
          corresponds to the contents of the file.  Manual uses the
          file names as an indication of the manual contents, eg. that
          the manual page for grep is in grep.1.  This is the way in
          which manual maintains its speed in searching, it scans
          directory files to determine the files contained within, and
          does not open individual manual page files to look at their
          contents.  If the file names and contents do not match this
          will create problems in trying to access the manual pages.

          Manual has no interface for printing manual pages.  It is
          purely an online, interactive tool.  Manual does display the
          full pathname of manuals it locates, and you can use this to
          find and print manual pages.
