       This document provides a basic user's guide to the
       SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME Version Environment (VE).  The general
       functionality, as well as the details of the syntax of
       invoking and using VE are described, but the internal
       implementation of the tool is not covered.

          Section 2 gives a high level description of the purpose
                    and use of VE, including an overview of the
                    current capabilities.

          Section 3 covers the details of the way that VE works,
                    contrasted to conventional text editors.
                    Special capabilities of VE, including
                    _r_e_f_e_a_t_u_r_i_n_g and _m_e_r_g_i_n_g are also covered.

          Section 4 covers the way in which VE is invoked,
                    including the interface to the Extended Change
                    Management System.

          Section 5 provides a detailed listing of the vvvviiii commands
                    available in VE.

          Section 6 provides a detailed listing of the eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss
                    commands available in VE.

          Section 7 describes the view menu and map and the version
                    expressions used therein.

       The VE user is assumed to be familiar with conventional text
       editors, particularly either vvvviiii or eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss.  Since VE is an
       extension of these editors, the common functionality is not
       described here, and standard reference documents for vvvviiii or
       eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss should be adequate.

       The SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME Version Environment (VE) provides a
       single command interface to activities with Source Code
       Control System (SCCS) maintained files, especially in the
       context of the Extended Change Management System (ECMS) and



                                                            4/16/93







       SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME VERSION ENVIRONMENT USER GUIDE      Page 2



       the AT&T Product Administration System (SABLIME).  VE is an
       alternative to eeeeddddggggeeeetttt, ssssggggeeeetttt, vvvviiii or eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss, and eeeeddddppppuuuutttt.
       Additionally, vvvveeee provides an interface to many other ECMS
       and SABLIME operations, including ssssggggeeeetttt, uuuunnnneeeeddddggggeeeetttt, uuuunnnneeeeddddppppuuuutttt,
       and rrrreeeeppppoooorrrrtttt.  Features of vvvveeee also provide alternatives to
       activities that normally would require ccccmmmmsssspppprrrr and qqqquuuueeeerrrryyyy.
       Similar capabilities are available for SCCS users not in an
       ECMS or SABLIME environment.

       The basic goal of vvvveeee is to make it easy to examine or change
       a file maintained under version control with ECMS, SABLIME,
       or SCCS.  Current conventional scenarios extract a "flat"
       image from ECMS/SABLIME/SCCS for editing, but to understand
       the origin of each line of the flat file extracted, expert
       knowledge of ECMS/SABLIME/SCCS and the SCCS file itself is
       usually required.  The distinguishing feature of vvvveeee is that
       the version information used for the extraction from
       ECMS/SABLIME/SCCS is available during the editing or
       browsing session.

       For an ECMS or SABLIME user, viewing a file and having the
       version information available can be as simple as

            vvvveeee gggg====5555eeee6666____1111kkkk RRRRTTTTmmmmaaaaiiiinnnn....mmmmdddd

       This places the user in the editor, with a view of the file
       that is equivalent to that obtained by

            ssssggggeeeetttt gggg====5555eeee6666____1111kkkk RRRRTTTTmmmmaaaaiiiinnnn....mmmmdddd

       However, _n_o _f_i_l_e _h_a_d _t_o _b_e _c_r_e_a_t_e_d _i_n _t_h_e _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y,
       version information is readily available, and the view of
       the file, equivalent to ssssggggeeeetttt with various combinations of
       parameters, is easily changed _w_i_t_h_o_u_t _l_e_a_v_i_n_g _t_h_e _e_d_i_t_o_r.
       Version information for the current line is easily displayed
       with the editor command ^^^^GGGG (in vvvviiii mode) or ^^^^XXXX^^^^GGGG (in eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss
       mode).  The version information shows the MR affecting the
       line, who did the change, when it was done, the status of
       the MR, and the abstract of the MR.

       Moreover, editing in the versioned environment is fully
       supported, with special handling for ECMS feature
       constructs.  There are also provisions for the automatic
       detection and merging of other changes to the file that
       might occur if the user is editing without having locked the
       file.

       In the ECMS or SABLIME environment, use of vvvveeee presumes some
       familiarity with ECMS or SABLIME; see the appropriate User's
       Manual.  For the plain SCCS environment, see the standard
       UNIX commands aaaaddddmmmmiiiinnnn,,,, ggggeeeetttt, and ddddeeeellllttttaaaa; vvvveeee has a built in aaaaddddmmmmiiiinnnn



                                                            4/16/93

       command that can be used to create an SCCS file from an
       ordinary file that is being edited.

       vvvveeee also operates on ordinary text files, so can provide a
       uniform editor interface when dealing with some files under
       ECMS, SABLIME, or SCCS, as well as ordinary files.  In
       particular, vvvveeee is suitable to specify as an editor to tools
       like ccccssssccccooooppppeeee, and will seek to treat named files as ECMS,
       SABLIME or SCCS files if at all possible.

       The VE interface emulates the screen editors vvvviiii and eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss,
       with a number of version specific extensions.

       The SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME Version Environment has these
       capabilities:

          - Accesses files directly from ECMS, SABLIME, or SCCS
            with a single command interface

          - Built-in commands to run eeeeddddggggeeeetttt, eeeeddddppppuuuutttt, etc.

          - Browse only mode in which all editing commands are
            prohibited

          - Display of version information (including the MR
            abstract) for current line, either on request or
            automatically

          - Search for the next line with the same video attribute
            or version as the current line, search for next line
            matching a given version expression

          - #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e constructs are automatically interpreted when
            reading, and such constructs are automatically
            generated according to the current feature and the
            nature of the change

          - Project isolation information is used to prevent the
            user from making changes that would produce cross
            project contamination as well as meaningless featuring

          - Automatic detection of other changes if editing has
            been done without locking the file.

          - Automatic merging of concurrent changes.

          - Ability to run rrrreeeeppppoooorrrrtttt to get ECMS or SABLIME
            information for a particular line

          - Ability to adjust base for editing by specifying lines
            to be hidden on the basis of the version attributes of
            the lines

          - Expressions of version attributes may be associated
            with video attributes to visually draw attention to
            interesting lines, with a version query language
            supporting:

               - Expression operators "and", "or", "not", and
                 grouping

               - Query keys delta, programmer, date, mr, mrstatus,
                 mrdate, and various keywords related to ECMS
                 featuring

               - Query relations ==, !=, <, <=, >, >=

          - The version expression to visibility and/or video
            attribute mapping may be saved in a file by itself and
            such mappings may be read from a file, or interactively
            specified

          - VVVViiii and eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss capabilities include:

               - All of the viewing and cursor movement commands,
                 e.g., paging and scrolling through file, basic
                 cursor movement, movement by words

               - All of the editing commands, e.g., input of new
                 text, deletion of characters, words, lines, and
                 marked areas

               - All of the buffer and file manipulation commands,
                 e.g. read, write, and multi-file editing

               - Ordinary files may be edited, so text can be
                 moved/copied between ordinary and versioned files.

               - Recent changes may be undone

       The following sections describe the actions taken by VE for
       some typical command scenarios.  Editing within VE is very
       similar to a normal text editor, but because of the
       additional dimension of version, there are some important
       differences.  The intent of the following sections is to
       clarify what happens differently in VE, compared to a
       conventional non-versioned text editor.



                                                            4/16/93

       3.1  BBBBaaaassssiiiicccc TTTTeeeerrrrmmmmssss

       A _d_e_l_t_a refers to a unit of change.  For VE, delta coincides
       with the SCCS use of delta, i.e., a unit of change recorded
       with the time that it was made, and the login making the
       change.  If VE is interfacing to SCCS through a Change
       Management System, then a delta will also be associated with
       an MR and a status and time for that MR.

       The _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _d_e_l_t_a refers to the delta that will be used to
       label the current unit of change, i.e., the change that
       takes place between the base extracted from SCCS and what is
       returned to SCCS.

       A _v_e_r_s_i_o_n refers to a set of attributes describing the
       origin and destiny of a line.  These attributes include the
       delta in which the line first appeared (i.e., the _i_n_s_e_r_t_i_n_g
       _d_e_l_t_a of the line), zero or more deltas in which the line
       was removed (i.e., _d_e_l_e_t_i_n_g _d_e_l_t_a_s for the line), and
       possibly a _f_e_a_t_u_r_e attribute of the line (e.g., as indicated
       by enclosing ECMS #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e directives).

       An _e_d_i_t_i_n_g _s_e_s_s_i_o_n refers to the sequence of reading a base
       from SCCS, making changes, and returning the changes to SCCS
       as a delta, i.e., a single unit of change.  During the
       editing session, VE may be entered and exited many times,
       saving information about the session to disk so that it may
       be resumed.  For the discussion here, editing session is
       delineated by retrieval from SCCS and return to SCCS.

       The _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _v_e_r_s_i_o_n refers to the attributes that describe
       the current unit of change.  The current version consists
       only of a delta (this will be the inserting delta of all
       lines added, and will be the deleting delta of lines removed
       during the editing session), and possibly a feature
       expression (this feature expression will be associated with
       lines inserted, and its negation with lines removed).  The
       delta of the current version is fixed for an editing
       session, but the feature attribute may be changed.

       The _v_i_e_w of the file is the way the file looks in the
       editor.  Lines may be _v_i_s_i_b_l_e or _i_n_v_i_s_i_b_l_e, and visible
       lines may be further distinguished by video attributes.

       A _v_i_d_e_o _a_t_t_r_i_b_u_t_e refers to a display attribute used to
       visually distinguish lines of text on the screen.  This may
       be highlighting, underlining, reverse video, different
       fonts, colors, or whatever terminal attributes can be
       exploited.  Terminal attributes are determined by the
       TTTTEEEERRRRMMMMIIIINNNNFFFFOOOO description for the current terminal type.
       Customized TTTTEEEERRRRMMMMIIIINNNNFFFFOOOO descriptions are usually required to

       fully exploit the distinguishable display attributes of a
       terminal.

       The _o_w_n_e_r of a line refers to the ECMS feature which is able
       to change a line as far as project isolation is concerned.
       The owner of a line is determined from the closest feature
       control directives surrounding the line that do not contain
       any negation.  The _i_n_n_e_r featuring of a line refers to the
       ECMS feature control that most closely surrounds the line.
       _E_n_c_l_o_s_i_n_g featuring for a line can refer to any of the ECMS
       feature controls within which the line is nested.  Thus, the
       following line is owned by _5_E_3__1_L, has inner featuring
       !_5_E_4__2_Q, and is enclosed by both _5_E_3__1_L and !_5_E_4__2_Q:

                          #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (_5_E_3__1_L)

       VE allows the use of version expressions to determine which
       lines are seen while editing, and what visual attributes are
       associated with the visible lines.  Each line has a version
       (of course many lines may have the same version), and a
       given version expression can be considered to evaluate as
       true or false for a given version.  That is, various
       versions can be thought of as _m_a_t_c_h_i_n_g the version
       expression.  (The syntax of version expressions is described
       in detail in a later section.)  Version expressions may be
       used to specify visibility or video attributes for the lines
       whose version matches an assigned expression.

       By default, all included lines are visible and all excluded
       lines are invisible.  The criteria for determining inclusion
       of lines (and therefore the default visibility) may be
       changed by the user.  Some of the options available apply
       only to ECMS or SABLIME files (corresponding to the options
       which may be specified to the ECMS or SABLIME ssssggggeeeetttt command),
       and some of the options apply only to SCCS files
       (corresponding to the options which may be specified to the
       UNIX ggggeeeetttt command).  Examples of inclusion options that may
       be specified are: a branch cutoff date (so that all deltas
       after the date are excluded, and all deltas before the date
       are included), restricting the included deltas to "official"
       deltas (where the corresponding MRs have been approved or
       integrated), a list of MRs to be included, etc.  In addition
       to affecting the default visibility of lines, inclusion

       options also affect how ECMS featuring is calculated (this
       is covered in a later section).

       The view menu may be used to make explicit visibility and
       invisibility assignments that may override the default
       visibility as described in the previous section.  In the
       view menu, to assign invisible to a version expression means
       that all lines whose version matches the version expression
       will not be displayed at all.  If a line is invisible, it is
       as if the line has ceased to exist, i.e, the cursor cannot
       be moved to it, no context search will scan it, the line is
       not counted in the line count of the file for line numbering
       purposes, and so on.  Thus, for VE, invisible lines are
       truly invisible; they do not figure into the operations of
       the visually oriented editor/browser.  Changing visibility
       assignments will, however, bring an invisible line back into
       the visual realm where the editor can deal with it.

       Because a particular version may match several different
       version expressions, there must be some convention regarding
       which matched expression determines the visibility value
       used to determine whether to display a line.  The rule here
       is very simple: version expressions are associated with the
       values of visible and invisible in chronological order (this
       is the order displayed in the visibility map list, i.e., the
       last entry is the most recent assignment), and the value
       assigned to a version is from the most recently specified
       matching version expression in the visibility map list.
       Thus the visibility map assignment list is traversed from
       bottom to top (most recent to oldest) when looking for a
       match, and the search is stopped with the first match.  If
       there is no match, then a default visibility determination
       is made according to the inclusion criteria as discussed in
       the previous section.

       For example, if invisible is assigned to versions which are
       deleted by the current MR, and visible is assigned to
       versions deleted by the current delta, then newly deleted
       lines will be visible.  Even though they are deleted by the
       current MR, they are also deleted by the current delta, and
       the more recent assignment takes precedence.  Lines deleted
       in previous sessions with the same MR, but earlier deltas,
       will not be displayed.

       VE will not permit visibility assignments which cause all
       lines to become invisible.  If such an assignment is made,
       VE will not allow the user to leave the view menu, for the
       simple reason that under such conditions, there is no
       reasonable place to put the cursor as the file is displayed.



                                                            4/16/93

       VE also allows the use of different display attributes to
       visually show the version of the lines of text being
       displayed.  Video attributes may be assigned to version
       expressions, and the lines whose version matches an
       expression assigned to a video attribute are then displayed
       with that video attribute.  (The matching is subject to the
       same "most recent visibility assignment" matching rule
       described in the previous section.)  The video attribute
       assignment is naturally only effective for visible lines.

       For example, if underline is assigned to versions whose MR
       status is _s_u_b_m_i_t_t_e_d, and then reverse is assigned to
       versions with programmer _d_l_a, a line inserted by _d_l_a and
       whose MR status is _s_u_b_m_i_t_t_e_d will display as reverse video.
       Similarly, if the same video attribute is assigned to two
       different version expressions, close inspection of the
       version of a line displayed with this video attribute is
       required to determine why this attribute is used.  As in the
       example above, if underline is assigned to MR status
       _s_u_b_m_i_t_t_e_d and underline is also assigned to programmer _d_l_a,
       and a line displays as underlined, it may be because its MR
       status is _s_u_b_m_i_t_t_e_d, or it was inserted by _d_l_a, or possibly
       both.  By displaying the version information of the line,
       the reason for the underlining can be determined.

       The actions that take place in VE in response to editing
       commands (i.e., commands that insert or delete text) may be
       more complex than in a conventional text editor.  The
       version context of the line affected by the editing command
       is critical in determining the resulting actions.  In the
       following sections, the various editing scenarios possible
       are described and no special visibility or video attribute
       assignments are assumed.

       3.3.1  IIIInnnnsssseeeerrrrttttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTeeeexxxxtttt

       Before discussing complicated version scenarios, the
       simplest case of text insertion is described: If the editor
       is in input mode and the next character typed would be
       inserted before the first character on a line or appended
       after the last character on a line, and if the next
       character typed is a _r_e_t_u_r_n, then the result is simply a
       new, blank line appearing on the screen in the appropriate
       place.  The version of the new line will be that it is
       inserted by the current delta, and the version of all other
       lines will remain unchanged.  The visual appearance of this
       action will be the same as for a conventional text editor -



                                                            4/16/93







       SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME VERSION ENVIRONMENT USER GUIDE      Page 9



       a new line has simply been added into the file.

       Now, however, assume that the editor is in input mode and
       the next character typed is not _r_e_t_u_r_n.  (The cursor may be
       at any position on a line, the character typed is to be
       inserted in front of the cursor.)  Two cases must be
       discussed here.

       First, if the line to which the character is to be added was
       inserted by the current delta (i.e., is a "new" line,
       perhaps created as described above), then the actions are as
       in a conventional text editor: the character is added into
       the line, and the display is adjusted accordingly.  The
       version of this adjusted line remains the same; it is still
       a "new" line, inserted by the current delta.

       The second case is where the line being added to is not a
       "current" line, i.e., its version indicates that it was
       inserted by a delta other than the current delta.  Another
       way of phrasing this is that the line is an "old" line from
       a previous delta (e.g., from a previous editing session).
       In this case, the "old" representation of the line is
       preserved, and a "new" representation, adjusted to reflect
       the additional character, is added.  The "old" line is
       referred to as the _a_r_c_h_i_v_e line in the discussion that
       follows.  Where there had been one line in the file, there
       are now two lines, differing only by one character.  Upon
       close inspection of the versions of the lines, the "old"
       line has the same delta configuration as before, but will
       show the current delta as an additional deleting delta.
       Thus, the "old" line does not belong to the current version,
       and is kept as part of the file only to show the history of
       the change (i.e., the way things were before the current
       delta).  On the other hand, the "new," adjusted
       representation of the line shows simply as being inserted by
       the current delta; it is thus a line introduced by the
       current editing session.

       It is in this type of change scenario that VE differs
       markedly from conventional editors.  Simply put, VE
       preserves information about the way things looked before the
       editing session began, using the version dimension of lines
       of the file to distinguish the current set of changes from
       the original state of the file.

       One other possibility for an insertion scenario is the
       situation where the character input is the _r_e_t_u_r_n character,
       but the position where it is to be added is neither before
       the beginning nor after the end.  If the line in which this
       occurs is a "current" line (inserted by the current delta),
       then the line is simply split into two lines, both of which



                                                            4/16/93







       SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME VERSION ENVIRONMENT USER GUIDE     Page 10



       show as inserted by the current delta.  However, if the line
       is an "old" line as above, then again the original
       representation is preserved, marked as deleted by the
       current delta, and two "new" lines, representing the
       splitting of the old line, are added to the file.

       The user has control over the manner in which these archived
       lines are displayed.  With the default visibility
       determination described in a previous section, VE behaves
       visually like a conventional editor.  That is, when a line
       is altered, it simply changes, and the archives described
       above are invisible.  However, the user may enable the
       display of archive lines (which are marked as deleted by the
       current delta).  For example, a view map rule specifying
       that lines matching the version expression "deleted by delta
       == %s" are to be visible will show the original (now
       deleted) lines.  In this case, the deleted lines will appear
       in the display along with the modified line.  It is highly
       recommended that to avoid confusion, video attribute
       assignments be used to make the display meaningful, e.g.,
       using the attribute "dim" for the deleted lines and/or the
       attribute "standout" for the modified lines.

       3.3.2  DDDDeeeelllleeeettttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTeeeexxxxtttt

       Much of the activity of deleting text resembles the actions
       taking place for text insertion.  If the command is given to
       delete a line, and that line is a "new" line, i.e., inserted
       by the current delta, then the line is discarded and the
       display adjusted appropriately.  This behavior is the same
       as one expects in a conventional text editor.  However, if
       the line deleted is not a currently inserted line, then the
       line's representation is not discarded, but rather only the
       version of the line is changed to reflect that the current
       delta is now a deleting delta for the line.  With the
       default visibility, this has the same visual appearance: the
       deleted line disappears.  However, as described earlier, the
       display of deleted lines can be enabled, and a video
       attribute assigned to such lines.  In this case, the
       deletion of the line will only cause the video attribute of
       the line to change, e.g., the line would change from normal
       display to dim display if deleted lines were made visible
       and assigned attribute "dim".  Of course, the version of the
       deleted line has been adjusted, and displaying the version
       will indicate that the line is deleted.  If the line is
       already marked as deleted by the current delta, then
       deleting it again is prohibited.

       Deletion of text, say a character, on a line is very similar
       to the insertion of a character.  If the line is "new," then
       the representation is adjusted, but no other actions are



                                                            4/16/93







       SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME VERSION ENVIRONMENT USER GUIDE     Page 11



       required.  If the line is not "new", then it is marked as an
       "old" line (deleted by the current delta), and a "new"
       representation of the line, reflecting the deleted
       character, is added to the display.  The "new" line will
       show as inserted by the current delta.

       If the character deleted is the _r_e_t_u_r_n character itself,
       then the action is that of joining two lines.  In this case,
       two different lines are affected.  For each of them, the
       same action as described above takes place, i.e., if its
       version is the current version, no "old" copy needs to be
       created, but if its version is not the current version, then
       an "old" copy, showing the current delta as deleting delta,
       must be created.  Given that these copies have been created
       if necessary, the two lines are joined, so that there is now
       only one line containing the text that had been on the two
       lines, and the version of the line is inserted by the
       current delta.

       Any other editing activity, e.g., deletion of words,
       changing to end of line, etc., can be viewed as a composite
       of the simple actions of single character insertion or
       deletion, and line insertion or deletion.  Thus all editing
       scenarios are covered by the previous discussion.

       In "autofeaturing" mode (the default), VE understands the
       initial feature control lines in a file, and generates
       additional control lines as needed.  The version of each
       line then contains the featuring implied by surrounding
       feature control lines.  It is important to note that the
       feature control lines used to determine this featuring are
       the "included" feature control lines.  That is, if inclusion
       options indicate that only certain deltas are included, then
       only the feature control lines indicated by these deltas are
       used to determine the feature of each line.  In particular,
       if the inclusion criteria are changed, then featuring is
       recalculated.

       The previous discussions of editing actions assumed that the
       file was "featureless", i.e., the file was not an ECMS
       featured file, so that all lines had versions with no
       feature.  The editing actions may be different for featured
       files.  Moreover, not all editing may be possible if the
       ECMS instance has project isolation checking enabled, since
       changes that would result in cross project contamination are
       prohibited.  Also, if the inclusion options do not specify
       the entire MR branch of the file (i.e., all deltas



                                                            4/16/93







       SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME VERSION ENVIRONMENT USER GUIDE     Page 12



       included), then editing is prohibited.  This is necessary
       since ECMS requires the featuring for a change to be based
       on the entire MR branch.

       The following sections describe editing actions when ECMS
       features are interpreted for a featured file.

       3.3.4.1  IIIInnnnsssseeeerrrrttttiiiioooonnnn ooooffff TTTTeeeexxxxtttt iiiinnnn aaaa FFFFeeeeaaaattttuuuurrrreeeedddd FFFFiiiilllleeee

       As in the scenarios already described, if new lines of text
       are added, the version of the new lines is the current
       version.  If the current version includes a feature, then
       the version of the new lines also includes that feature.

       First consider the case where the current version has no
       feature specified.  This indicates that new text is to be
       "unfeatured", i.e., should be extractable in all feature
       configurations.  If the new line is added between unfeatured
       lines, then the new line will be unfeatured.  If the new
       line is added between lines that are only featured out for
       some feature (e.g., #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (!_A)), then the new line will
       also be similarly featured out.  If the new line is added
       between lines that are featured in for some feature (e.g.,
       #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (_A)), and project isolation is enabled, then the
       insertion will not be permitted, since doing so would
       "break" the feature block and produce contamination.  (If
       project isolation is not enabled, the line will be added as
       an unfeatured line, requiring that the active featuring be
       ended and restarted.)

       The second case to consider is when the current version
       specifies a feature, say feature _A.  This indicates that new
       text is to have feature _A.  If the new line is added between
       lines that are already featured for _A, then the new line is
       just inserted and inherits the featuring of the surrounding
       lines (including whatever feature nesting is indicated by
       the surrounding lines).  If the new line is added between
       unfeatured lines, then the new line will be simply be
       featured for _A, i.e., generated feature control lines of
       #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (_A) and #_e_n_d_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (_A) will surround the new line.
       If the new line is added between lines otherwise featured,
       then it will inherit the indicated nesting and also be
       featured for _A, i.e., feature control lines will be
       generated as above.  These latter actions may be prohibited
       if the project information indicates that the resulting
       featuring would not be extractable for the current project.

       As in the standard editing scenarios, deletion of text of a
       line that has the current delta just results in the line
       being changed as in conventional editing.  However, if text
       from an "old" line is deleted, and the file is featured, a
       different strategy must be taken, depending upon the feature
       of the current version and the feature of the line being
       changed.  If the feature "owning" the line is the same as
       the feature of the current version, then the change can be
       handled as in the non-featured case: the current delta is
       added as a deleting delta to the original line, and an
       altered copy with the current delta as inserting delta, and
       featuring the same as the original line, is added.  (The
       "owner" of a line is defined as the innermost feature
       control with no negation that appears around the line.)  If
       the feature "owning" the line is different from the feature
       of the current version, then the change must be handled by
       adjusting featuring.  If the current version has no feature,
       then no changes are allowed to lines owned by a feature.
       Otherwise, the original line is featured out for the current
       feature, and the altered copy is featured in for the current
       feature, respecting whatever feature nesting may occur
       already.  A simple example should make this clear:

         The line
              _a_b_c_d_e_f_g
         effectively becomes
              #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (!_A)
              _a_b_c_d_e_f_g
              #_e_n_d_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (!_A)
              #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (_A)
              _c_d_e_f_g
              #_e_n_d_f_e_a_t_u_r_e (_A)
         when the first two characters are deleted and the current
         feature is _A.

       VE provides a special capability to limit editing activities
       to modifying the featuring control constructs without
       affecting any lines enclosed by the feature control.  This
       is useful when code is "ported" from one project to another
       by changing the featuring, or when an incorrect choice for
       featuring must be corrected.  Since this type of activity
       would typically violate the usual cross project
       contamination checks, a special MR that can make changes in
       any project is required.

       In the 5ESS8r9 Software Development Environment, an "X" MR,
       associated with the special project "r1xr2", is permitted to

       SCCS/ECMS/SABLIME VERSION ENVIRONMENT USER GUIDE     Page 14



       make changes for all feature constructs.  The changes by an
       "X" MR are unconstrained by ECMS, but a common use of such
       MRs is to just change feature control lines.  To support
       this, VE recognizes "X" MRs (i.e., those that have project
       "r1xr2"), and requires the user to also provide the feature
       to be changed and the feature to change it to (options oooollllddddffff
       and nnnneeeewwwwffff).  Under such conditions, VE will disable all
       normal editing commands, but all file navigation commands
       will work as usual.  The only editing activity recognized is
       the request to change the featuring for a block of featured
       lines.  To do this, the block must be featured by the given
       features (either positively or negatively), and the cursor
       must be positioned on the beginning or ending feature
       control line.  The command ^^^^VVVVxxxx (^^^^XXXXxxxx in eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss mode), will
       then change the feature in both control constructs according
       to the given features.  To provide visual reinforcement of
       this change, VE provides a default view map for "X" MR usage
       that highlights blocks featured by the old and new features.

       If the user wants to do this type of editing and does not
       have an assigned "X" MR, specifying no MR, but giving the
       old and new feature names will activate the refeaturing
       mode.  Note that in this case no eeeeddddggggeeeetttt can be done until a
       real "X" MR is assigned.  If the need arises to do some
       conventional editing with an "X" MR, changing the mode to
       turn off _a_u_t_o_f_e_a_t_u_r_i_n_g will allow usual editing of the file,
       including feature control lines.  However, this defeats the
       purpose of assuring that editing is constrained to feature
       control line changes, so should only be used in extreme
       circumstances.

       The editing actions described earlier often result in an
       "archive" line, i.e., a copy of a line prior to a change but
       with its version adjusted to show it has been logically
       deleted (by a deleting delta or by featuring out).  If
       migration is enabled, then an attempt is made to move the
       archive line above other lines that were inserted in the
       current delta, so that editing several consecutive lines
       results in two blocks of text, one representing the "before"
       block, and one the "after," rather than having old and new
       lines alternately in the file.

       This migration is especially desirable in the case of
       featured files, where editing might otherwise result in
       lines featured alternately _A and _n_o_t _A, which requires the
       generation of four feature control lines, leading to
       completely unreadable code.  Archive migration tends to
       reduce this fragmentation by attempting to group lines
       having common feature attributes together, by interchanging



                                                            4/16/93

       VE allows editing to take place in the image retrieved from
       ECMS, SABLIME, or SCCS  without requiring that the file be
       locked by eeeeddddggggeeeetttt.  Although this type of use is discouraged
       (and VE warns whenever a file is saved and it is not locked
       for an MR), it may sometimes be necessary, e.g., an urgent
       change is required and someone else has the file locked, or
       experimental changes are being tried to determine if an MR
       is really needed.  The danger in such scenarios is that
       other deltas may be recorded under to the underlying SCCS
       file while the file is unlocked.  If this occurs without the
       knowledge of the user and the current changes are then
       recorded under SCCS, this delta will wipe out the changes
       made by the other delta.  To keep this from happening, VE
       checks to see if the SCCS file has changed since it was
       initially read and will not permit a delta to be made until
       the two sets of changes are reconciled.

       The reconciliation of concurrent changes is accomplished by
       an automatic merging operation (::::mmmmeeeerrrrggggeeee in vvvviiii mode, ^^^^XXXXeeeemmmmeeeerrrrggggeeee
       in eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss mode).  Invoking this operation will cause the more
       recent underlying SCCS file to be read, and the current
       editing session's delta (i.e., its insertions and deletions)
       will be applied to this new base.  The editor reports the
       size of both changes, and adjusts the view map to highlight
       both sets of changes.  At this point, the user can inspect
       the merged result to determine if there are logical or
       physical conflicts that require manual intervention.  In any
       case, the image maintained by VE is now up to date with
       respect to the underlying SCCS file, so editing, and
       operations like eeeeddddggggeeeetttt, may continue.

       When vvvvbbbb or vvvveeee is invoked, its editing mode will be either vvvviiii
       or eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss, depending on the shell environment variable EEEEDDDDIIIITTTTOOOORRRR
       (or EEEEDDDDIIIITTTTOOOORRRR4444VVVVEEEE if EEEEDDDDIIIITTTTOOOORRRR is not recognizable as vvvviiii or eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss).
       If the tool is invoked as vvvvbbbb, then only commands for
       perusing the text are enabled; all commands which change
       text or write out the file are disabled.  More than one file
       name may be specified, allowing the user to work through a
       list of files without exiting the editor between each file.
       (Search expressions and named buffer contents are preserved
       between files.)

       In vvvviiii mode, if the shell environment variable VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT is set
       and not null, its value will be interpreted as an "ex" type
       of command to be performed before interactive editing
       begins.  Thus, if VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT is set to "se ai showversion",
       automatic indenting and constant version display of the
       current line will be enabled.

       In eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss mode, the commands in any $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE////....vvvveeee____iiiinnnniiiitttt file will
       be executed when vvvveeee is invoked.

       By default, for ECMS featured files, at startup all #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e
       and #_e_n_d_f_e_a_t_u_r_e lines are interpreted, and used to assign
       feature as part of the version of the lines they enclose.
       The control lines are not editable.  Additional control
       lines are generated as required by the editing.  Feature
       control directives that are not included (as indicated by
       the ssssggggeeeetttt-type parameters) are ignored for the purposes of
       feature interpretation, and no feature attribute is assigned
       to text lines that are not included.  If the shell
       environment variable VVVVEEEEFFFFEEEEAAAATTTTUUUURRRREEEE is set and not null, or a
       value is specified on the command line, the current feature
       in the editor will be set to its value; this is the
       featuring that will be used throughout the editing session.
       (See the section on VE specific commands for commands to
       change the current feature.)  If VVVVEEEEFFFFEEEEAAAATTTTUUUURRRREEEE is not set, but
       FFFFEEEEAAAATTTTUUUURRRREEEE is set, then the first changeable feature named by
       FFFFEEEEAAAATTTTUUUURRRREEEE is used for the current feature.  If neither of
       these variables is set, and project isolation does not allow
       non-featured code to be changed, then a current feature is
       chosen, first trying for a feature with the same name as the
       project, then looking for a changeable feature of required,
       included, or allowed status (in that order).

       VE determines what to read into its buffer for editing or
       browsing according to the file name given on the command
       line and the following rules:

          - If the option ffffoooorrrrcccceeeeoooorrrrddddiiiinnnnaaaarrrryyyy====yyyy was specified to force
            ordinary file behavior, then the named file is simply
            read as an ordinary file.  If the file does not exist,
            the buffer will be initially empty.

          - If the file named by adding the prefix "SSSS...." to the
            given name exists, then it is assumed to be the result
            of saving a previous session with VE, and that session
            will be resumed by using the contents of the saved
            versioned file.

          - If the file named by adding the prefix "ssss...." to the
            given name exists, then it is assumed to be an SCCS
            file, and the buffer is initialized by reading the text
            lines from that file.  If an SCCS directory has been
            specified, the check for the SCCS file will be tried
            first in that directory, relative to any directory
            indicated by the file name given.  Note that aaaaddddmmmmiiiinnnn is
            used to create an SCCS file initially, e.g.,
               aaaaddddmmmmiiiinnnn ----iiii////ddddeeeevvvv////nnnnuuuullllllll ssss....ffffiiiilllleeee
            or the builtin aaaaddddmmmmiiiinnnn command of ve can be used.

          - If there is no ECMS or SABLIME environment (no ECMS
            prefix file or SABLIME global data base has been
            determined or no generic has been given) then the named
            file is simply read as an ordinary file.

          - If the name given is a full path name, it is compared
            to each node in the shell VVVVPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH variable, and if it
            matches one of those nodes, the node part of the name
            is ignored, and the file is accessed as an ECMS or
            SABLIME file (see next item).  If it does not match any
            node in the VVVVPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH, or is not a valid ECMS or SABLIME
            name, it is treated as an ordinary file.

          - If an ECMS or SABLIME environment exists and a generic
            has been specified, then the buffer is initialized from
            the ECMS or SABLIME data base.  The file to read from
            the data base is determined by using the base name of
            the given file name, and a directory determined from
            the ddddiiiirrrr option or the current directory's relative
            location in the first node of VVVVPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH, plus any directory
            portion of the given name.  If such a file does not
            exist under ECMS or SABLIME for the given generic, VE
            behavior will be as if the ffffoooorrrrcccceeeeoooorrrrddddiiiinnnnaaaarrrryyyy====yyyy option had

       The following command line options apply to SCCS, ECMS,
       SABLIME, and ordinary file usage.

       ----VVVV      causes the release of the version editor to be

       ++++_n      causes the initial display to have the cursor
               positioned at line number _n.

       ++++////_R_E    causes the initial display to have the cursor
               positioned at the first line containing the regular
               expression _R_E.

       The following options control editing activity.  Except for
       the first three, these options apply only to SCCS, ECMS, or
       SABLIME usage.  In addition to being specified on the
       command line, each of these options may also be given a new
       value during the editing session.  In vvvviiii mode, this is

                 one of the directories in VVVVPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH, then relative
                 path names imply the portion of the path from the

                 path names to files are given, and the initial
                 portion of the name matches any node in VVVVPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH,
                 then the remaining portion of the name is assumed
                 to be the ECMS or SABLIME file desired, if it
                 exists under ECMS or SABLIME.

       Following are some examples of different ways that VE may be
       invoked.

             Assuming that PPPPRRRROOOOJJJJEEEECCCCTTTT is set to 5e5_1u and that the

             is read from the ECMS data base and the initial view
             contains only the approved MRs and has feature control
             lines evaluated for generic 5e5_1u and project 5e5_1u.

             The same file is read from ECMS, but an eeeeddddggggeeeetttt command
             is executed, and the initial view will contain all
             MRs, and the whole file (with feature control lines)
             will be displayed.  Note that if the mmmmrrrr and eeeeddddggggeeeetttt
             parameters had not been specified, the initial view
             would be as in the previous example.  However, the

             specified while in the editor, and eeeeddddggggeeeetttt could also be
             executed, producing the same effect.

             Assuming that some editing had taken place in the
             previous example and the changes were saved and vvvveeee was
             exited, this command causes the saved file

             existing saved versioned file for ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e, the
             ordinary file ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e is edited.

       For the above word movements, a word is defined as a
       sequence of letters, digits, or underscores, or else a
       sequence of other non white space characters.  If a capital
       letter is used as the word movement, a simpler definition of
       just non white space characters is used.  A paragraph
       beginning is indicated by a blank line or a line with just
       white space.  The definition of a function is indicated by
       the character '{' in the first column.

                    old and new features given on the command line.

                    the current delta can be undeleted.  This
                    operator works like other vvvviiii operators, e.g.,
                    ^^^^VVVVuuuuuuuu undeletes one line, ^^^^VVVVuuuu''''aaaa undeletes from

       Following are the eeeexxxx type commands available from the VE.
       These commands are invoked by entering ::::, the command, and
       then RRRREEEETTTTUUUURRRRNNNN or EEEESSSSCCCC.  This mode may be entered permanently by
       quitting visual mode with the visual command QQQQ (the ex
       command vvvviiiissssuuuuaaaallll will return the editor to visual mode).  VE
       will start in this mode if _E_D_I_T_O_R=_e_x.  For those commands
       allowing file names, and for shell commands, the special
       characters %%%% and #### are replaced by the current file name and
       previous file name, respectively.  Shell metacharacters are
       also expanded.  Most of these commands may be preceded by a
       single line number, or a range of line numbers, where the
       line numbers may be absolute numbers, . for the current
       line, $ for the last line, a mark name, or a context search.
       In addition, a constant may be added to or subtracted from
       the relative references.  If a line reference only is given,
       with no command, the action is to move the cursor to the
       beginning of the line specified.  Some of the commands
       require an extra argument which could be a count, a mark
       name, a destination line address, etc.  Commands may be
       abbreviated, often by one character; the minimal
       abbreviation is shown in bold face.  Many commands also have
       a variant form which is indicated by a trailing !!!!  on the
       command name.

          !!!!            execute a command in the shell, if a line
                       range is given, the lines are input to the
                       command and the resulting output replaces
                       the lines

          !!!!!!!!           re-execute last command executed in the
                       shell

          PPPP         Produce a printable dump of visible lines of
                    the file.  The result of this command will

                    paper copy of the visible lines of the buffer,
                    including video attribute information.  An
                    appropriate filter is required to properly
                    print the dump; its format consists of the view
                    map (see description of view map files later)
                    and the text lines.  Text lines consist of 'T',
                    followed by a space, followed by a string
                    representing the video attribute, followed by a

                    used to determine the location of the created

                    editing can continue if you choose to re-read
                    the file; it will now be treated as an SCCS

          mmmmeeeerrrrggggeeee     For SCCS, ECMS, or SABLIME files, merge the
                    changes from the current editing session to the
                    original SCCS file.  If the original SCCS file
                    has not changed since initial retrieval for the
                    current changes, nothing is done.  (However,
                    for ECMS and SABLIME files, the MR status
                    information for the current generic is updated
                    since this information affects the view, even
                    though the underlying SCCS file is logically
                    equivalent.)  If it has changed, the current
                    changes are applied to this new base in a
                    reasonable fashion.  A report of the number of
                    lines inserted and deleted will be given, and
                    the view map will be adjusted to give
                    highlighting to lines inserted or deleted since
                    original retrieval, and to lines inserted or
                    deleted by the current session.  These changes
                    should be inspected to insure that the changes
                    are still relevant, correctly placed, and
                    desired before formally recording them under

                    with the MR (delta) that inserted it.  If a
                    visible line is deleted by an MR (delta), show
                    the deleting MR (delta), too.  Include line

       Users who prefer to have certain options set all the time
       may do so through the use of the VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT environment
       variable.  During editor initialization, the value of this
       variable (if set and exported) is treated as a command typed
       in to ex (i.e. after typing a colon in command mode).  Thus
       a user wishing to always see version and sccsid information
       would set VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT="set showversion showsccsid" and export
       VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT.  Note that neither a colon nor a trailing newline is
       required.

       The use of the VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT variable is not limited to setting
       options; any command from the ve extended ex command set may
       be specified, including multi-line commands (by embedding
       newlines in the VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT string).  One potential application
       is to use the VVVV command to enter the view menu on startup,
       rather than going directly to the file display.  Note
       however that commands specified through VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT will be
       executed during editor initialization, so it is unwise to
       use commands that rely on the file buffer and/or screen
       display having been initialized.  Alternatively, if VVVVEEEEIIIINNNNIIIITTTT
       is not set or is null, but the file $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE////....vvvveeeerrrrcccc exists,
       startup commands will be from this file.



       6.  EEEEmmmmaaaaccccssss

       This section describes the eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss mode of VE.

       6.1  EEEEmmmmaaaaccccssss CCCCoooommmmmmmmaaaannnnddddssss

       Emacs uses the following notation to display and input non-
       printing characters:

          ^^^^XXXX        Control-X, where X is any character.

          MMMM----xxxx       Meta-x, where x is any character (including a
                    control character).

       Meta characters are entered by typing escape followed by
       another character.  Many emacs commands take an optional
       numeric argument. The argument for a command precedes the
       command itself, and can be specified a number of ways.
       Typing ^U specifies an argument of 4, or 4 times the current
       argument. Typing escape followed by a sequence of digits
       with or without a leading '-' specifies a decimal value.

       Following are the eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss commands currently implemented in
       VE.  If the command acts differently than in eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss it will
       be noted.

                    line, and switches the featuring between the
                    old and new features given on the command line.
                    These features may be changed by ^X^Moldf=f or

       Mode parameters allow you to customize the behavior of
       certain commands.  Some modes are switches, indicating only
       that something is either on or off, while others are numeric
       parameters.  Modes can be set by the ^X^M command.  Typing
       ^X^M followed by the name of a switch mode turns it on,
       typing ^U^X^M followed by the name turns it off.  To set
       numeric modes, give the value you want as an argument to
       ^X^M, e.g. M-50^X^Mmode_name.  You can set modes in a
       $HOME/.ve_init file, just like the $HOME/.emacs_init file.
       If you do not have a $HOME/.ve_init file, VE will run the
       ~VE/.ve_init default initialization file, just like eeeemmmmaaaaccccssss
       runs the ~EMACS/.emacs_init file.  The default setting and
       "read only" status is given in parentheses at the end of
       each description.  Some modes are "read only" because they
       only exist to be read by macros.

       This section describes how to use the view menu to create a
       view map to get a versioned view of the file.

       7.1  VVVViiiieeeewwww MMMMeeeennnnuuuu CCCCoooommmmmmmmaaaannnnddddssss

       Following are the commands available from the view menu:

          aaaa  Assign an attribute to a version expression, the
             version expression and attribute will be prompted for;
             the number of an existing entry may be given if the
             same version expression is desired; the attribute may
             be specified as one or more letters from the displayed
             attribute code list (multiple codes will combine
             attributes)

          vvvv  Assign visibility to a version expression, the version
             expression and visibility value will be prompted for;
             the number of an existing entry may be given if the
             same version expression is desired

          mmmm  Modify the visibility or attribute associated with an
             assigned version expression

          dddd  Delete a single visibility or attribute assignment, or
             all current assignments

          rrrr  Read visibility and attribute assignments from a file,
             appending to the current assignments

          wwww  Write out the current visibility and attribute
             assignments to a file

          iiii  Specify inclusion options.  The options are specified
             as _o_p_t_i_o_n__n_a_m_e=_v_a_l_u_e, and any of the command line
             options may be given.  See the descriptions of the
             command line options, or ECMS/SABLIME ssssggggeeeetttt for more
             details).

          ^^^^LLLL Refresh the screen

          qqqq  Quit the view menu, return to edit window

       As noted earlier, a standard set of view mappings is
       provided when VE initially reads a file from ECMS, SABLIME,
       or SCCS.  The shell environment variable VVVVIIIIEEEEWWWWMMMMAAAAPPPP may be used
       to provide one's own view assignments.  When the version
       editor starts up, if VVVVIIIIEEEEWWWWMMMMAAAAPPPP is set and not null, then its
       value will be interpreted as the name of a file containing
       view assignments which will replace the view assignments



                                                            4/16/93

       contained within the versioned file itself.  Such files are
       most easily created with the view menu commands above; the
       next section details the format of the assignments in file
       form.

       7.2  VVVViiiieeeewwww MMMMaaaapppp FFFFiiiilllleeeessss

       View mappings may be stored separately in a file of just
       view mappings (as produced by the wwww selection in the view
       menu).  View mappings are of two types, visibility
       assignment, or video attribute assignment, and appear in
       files as follows.

       Visibility mappings are lines of the form:
            BBBB _c _v_e_r_s_i_o_n__e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
       where the line begins with BBBB (for view BBBBase), is followed by
       a single space, then a character corresponding to the
       visibility (i=invisible, v=visible), another single space,
       and then the text of a version expression.  The text of the
       expression may contain spaces.

       Video attribute mappings are lines of the form:
            AAAA _a _v_e_r_s_i_o_n__e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n
       where the line begins with AAAA, is followed by a single space,
       then a character string corresponding to the video
       attributes, another single space, and then the text of a
       version expression.  The text of the expression may contain
       spaces.  Such a line thus represents a mapping of an
       attribute to a version expression.  The character string
       representing the attributes is formed from the following
       values corresponding to basic curses terminal attributes:

            n       normal
            s       standout
            u       underline
            r       reverse
            f       blink
            d       dim
            b       bold
            a       alternate

       The rrrr selection in the view menu will read such lines from a
       specified file, and any line not beginning with AAAA or BBBB is
       ignored.  Thus, the view map from a saved versioned SSSS....file
       is easily read into the editor while working with a
       different file.








                                                            4/16/93

       Visibility or attributes may be assigned to a version
       expression from the view menu (or by reading the assignment
       from a file).  A version expression is a "primitive" version
       expression, or is formed by combining version expressions
       with expression operators.  The version expression can be
       regarded as a means of selecting versions.  Thus, a version
       expression is considered as true or false with respect to a
       particular version, i.e., the set of version attributes of a
       line of the file being edited.  Or, one may regard the
       version expression as matching or not matching the version
       attributes of a line.  The following sections give the
       details.

       7.3.1  EEEExxxxpppprrrreeeessssssssiiiioooonnnn OOOOppppeeeerrrraaaattttoooorrrrssss

       The following operators may be used to combine version
       expressions into more complex version expressions:

         (((( ))))         Used for grouping of expressions

         !!!!  or nnnnooootttt   Logical negation of an expression

         &&&&&&&& or aaaannnndddd   Logical conjunction of two expressions

         |||||||| or oooorrrr    Logical disjunction of two expressions

       Primitive version expressions are usually formed with a
       keyword, a relation operator, and a value.  The keywords
       that may be used in primitives are:

         ddddeeeellllttttaaaa       Used to select by an SCCS delta identifier
                     (SID).  The keyword ssssiiiidddd may also be used here.
                     [The value specified is an SID.]

         rrrreeeelllleeeeaaaasssseeee     Used to select by the release portion of an
                     SCCS delta identifier (SID).  Similarly,
                     lllleeeevvvveeeellll, bbbbrrrraaaannnncccchhhh, and sssseeeeqqqquuuueeeennnncccceeee can be used to
                     select on the basis of other parts of an SID.

                     also be used here.
                     [The value specified is a login name.]

         mmmmrrrrddddaaaatttteeee      Used to select by the date of the status
                     change of the ECMS/SABLIME MR associated with
                     the delta.  Once the MR is approved, this date
                     will remain fixed, i.e., it will correspond to
                     the date of the delta on the official branch.
                     In particular, the date will not change when
                     the generic is integrated (since no new deltas
                     are created by that activity).  The keyword

       be prefixed by iiiinnnnsssseeeerrrrtttteeeeddddbbbbyyyy, ddddeeeelllleeeetttteeeeddddbbbbyyyy, or aaaaffffffffeeeecccctttteeeeddddbbbbyyyy, with an
       optional space before and after the bbbbyyyy.  Such a prefix
       indicates, for those version expressions that match
       attributes associated with the change history, whether to
       match against inserting or deleting attributes, or both.
       The prefix '~~~~' is also recognized as shorthand for
       ddddeeeelllleeeetttteeeeddddbbbbyyyy, and the prefix '****' is recognized as shorthand for

       assumed.

       Also, the values used in a version expression may contain
       the following control sequences, which will be replaced as
       indicated:

       The relational operators that may be used in primitive
       version expressions are:

         ========        Attribute is equal to value specified

         !!!!====        Attribute is not equal to value specified

          - Comma separated lists may be used to specify multiple
            values for the operators ======== and !!!!====.

          - Only the ======== operator can be used with keyword eeeexxxxttttrrrraaaacccctttt
            to specify the list of features for which extracted
            lines are to match.

          - Only the operators ======== and !!!!==== are meaningful with
            keywords oooowwwwnnnneeeerrrr and iiiinnnnnnnneeeerrrr.

          - For ECMS files, the status of MRs that were completed
            prior to the file being addsrc'ed for this generic (and
            thus may not exist in this generic) is set to the
            pseudo status of "addsrc".

          - The special value "official" may be used with the
            keyword mmmmrrrrssssttttaaaattttuuuussss as shorthand for

             that the quotation marks are necessary so that "!" is

             Such lines might not be enclosed within any #_f_e_a_t_u_r_e
             construct, or may be enclosed in only negative

       Following are the view map assignments provided by VE for a
       featured ECMS file, shown much as they would appear in the
       view map menu.

            Visibility assignments:

            Attribute assignments:
             2. (s) inserted by mr == %m
             3. (u) deleted by mr == %m

       The first attribute assignment causes lines inserted by the
       current MR to be displayed in standout mode.  The second
       attribute assignment causes lines deleted by the current MR
       to be underlined.
