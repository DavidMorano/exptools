          This program slows down printing of a file by inserting
          delays.  The default is to insert a 1 second delay between
          the printing of each line.  The user may specify a longer
          delay (in seconds) by using the -d option.  The user may
          also specify the number of lines to be printed before each
          delay by using the -l option.

          Another option is to specify the number of characters
          between delays by using the -c option.  If the -c option is
          used, the -l option is ignored.  Carriage returns are
          counted as a single character with the -c option.

          This program is useful as a buffer between high speed
          computer lines (9.6 Kbs) and slow speed printers that don't
          have flow control.

           -c CHARS   number of characters before delay
                      (the default is to count lines)
           -d DELAY   delay in seconds between prints (default = 1)
           -l LINES   number of lines before delay (default = 1)

          Print the file "FILE" one line at a time with a one second
          delay between each line:   "cat FILE | slow"

          Print two files three lines at a time with a one second
          delay after three lines print:    " slow -l3 FILE1 FILE2"

          Print five lines of FILE1 then delays 2 seconds, then 5 more
          lines, then delay 2 seconds.  Continue until the entire file
          is printed:   " slow -l 5 -s2 FILE1"

          If the -c option is used, the printing will still be at line
          boundaries, since line buffering is used in the program I/O.
