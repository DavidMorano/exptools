     NAME
          splitpath - Print components of a directory path list

     SYNOPSIS
          splitpath [ -V ] [ _p_a_t_h_l_i_s_t(_n_a_m_e) ] ...

     DESCRIPTION
          This command prints to standard output the  individual  com-
          ponents  of  a  colon separated path list, one per line.  An
          initial colon, ending colon, or two  colons  together  in  a
          path  list  cause  a  dot (.) to be printed (for the current
          directory).  No checks are made as to the  validity  of  the
          components of the path list.

          Each argument is either the name of an environment  variable
          that  contains  the  path  (_e._g. CDPATH), or the actual path
          (_e._g. $CDPATH).  The existence of a colon  (:),  slash  (/),
          dot (.) or dash (-) in the argument distinguishes the latter
          type of argument from the former.

          If no argument is specified, it uses  the  PATH  environment
          variable.

          The -V option reports the program  version  number,  and  if
          there are no other command line arguments, simply exits.

     EXAMPLES
          # List all commands in my PATH:
          lf `splitpath`

          # List directories in my CDPATH:
          splitpath CDPATH

          # List all directories of my PATH and CDPATH:
          splitpath PATH $CDPATH
