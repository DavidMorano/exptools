          _D_e_t_e_x (Version 2.2) reads each file in sequence, removes all
          comments and _T_e_X control sequences and writes the remainder
          on the standard output.  All text in math mode and display
          mode is removed.  By default, _d_e_t_e_x follows \input commands.
          If a file cannot be opened, a warning message is printed and
          the command is ignored.  If the ----nnnn option is used, no \input
          or \include commands will be processed.  This allows single
          file processing.  If no input file is given on the command
          line, _d_e_t_e_x reads from standard input.

          If the magic sequence ``\begin{document}'' appears in the
          text, _d_e_t_e_x assumes it is dealing with LaTeX source and
          _d_e_t_e_x recognizes additional constructs used in _L_a_T_e_X.  These
          include the \include and \includeonly commands.  The ----llll
          option can be used to force LaTeX mode.

          Text in various environment modes of _L_a_T_e_X is ignored.  The
          default modes are array, eqnarray, equation, figure,
          picture, table and verbatim.  The ----eeee option can be used to
          specify a comma separated _e_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t-_l_i_s_t of environments
          to ignore.  The list replaces the defaults so specifying an
          empty list effectively causes no environments to be ignored.

          The ----cccc option can be used in LaTeX mode to have detex echo
          the arguments to \cite, \ref, and \pageref macros.  This can
          be useful when sending the output to a style checker.

          _D_e_t_e_x assumes the standard character classes are being used
          for _T_e_X.  _D_e_t_e_x allows white space between control sequences
          and magic characters like `{' when recognizing things like
          _L_a_T_e_X environments.

          If the ----wwww flag is given, the output is a word list, one
          `word' (string of two or more letters and apostrophes
          beginning with a letter) per line, and all other characters
          ignored.  Without ----wwww the output follows the original, with
          the deletions mentioned above.  Newline characters are
          preserved where possible so that the lines of output match
          the input as closely as possible.

          The TEXINPUTS environment variable is used to find \input
          and \include files.

          Note that previous versions of _d_e_t_e_x would replace control

          sequences with a space character to prevent words from
          running together.  However, this caused accents in the
          middle of words to break words, generating "spelling errors"
          that were not desirable.  The old functionality can be
          essentially duplicated by using the ----ssss option.

          Nesting of \input is allowed but the number of opened files
          must not exceed the system's limit on the number of
          simultaneously opened files.  _D_e_t_e_x ignores unrecognized
          option characters after printing a warning message.

          _D_e_t_e_x is not a complete _T_e_X interpreter, so it can be
          confused by some constructs.  Most errors result in too much
          rather than too little output.

          Running _L_a_T_e_X source without a ``\begin{document}'' through
          _d_e_t_e_x may produce errors.

          Suggestions for improvements are encouraged.
