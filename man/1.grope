	    Not	to be out done by _g_r_e_p,	this command allows the	user to
	    ``grope'' around a dictionary for misspelled words.	 The
	    effort is a	simple application for Rick Boivie's creative
	    algorithm that globally searches for an ``irregular''
	    expression.	 _G_r_o_p_e will search for each of the words given
	    on the command line, and then prompt on standard input for
	    additional search words.  If just a	carriage return	is
	    typed, the next best entry will be returned	for each car-
	    riage return.  To quit, enter _q or type a control-D.

	    The	algorithm will count the number	of letter matches to
	    determine the best word match.  To break ties, it will take
	    the	word with the least number of letters. The 53000 word
	    dictionary is a limiting factor for	a successful word
	    retrieval.

	    The	----ssss option indicates that each requested	word should be
	    printed out	before the matches.

	    The	----nnnn option specifies how	many matches should be initially
	    printed for	each word.

	    The	----1111 option indicates that all matches for each requested
	    word should	be printed on a	single line.

	    The	----iiii option indicates _g_r_o_p_e should not read standard input
	    for	further	words after exhausting the words given on the
	    command line.

	    The	----llll option indicates an alternate library directory for
	    _g_r_o_p_e to look in for its dictionary	files.	In that	direc-
	    tory should	be a series of files named ddddiiiicccc____aaaa through ddddiiiicccc____zzzz,
	    one	each for the letters of	the alphabet.  In each file
	    should be a	sorted list of the words which start with that
	    letter.

	    The	----VVVV option prints the current version and exits.

	    _g_s_p_e_l_l, given a filename, returns the misspelled words fol-
	    lowed by their dictionary look-up.
