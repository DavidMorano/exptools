          The _t_o_o_l_i_n_f_o command provides information about optional
          exptools.  Without arguments, the command displays
          information about all optional exptools.  With arguments,
          only information about the given tools is displayed.

          Normally, documentation about a tool is only available on a
          machine that subscribes to it.  This command, however,
          provides a way for information about a tool to be displayed
          on all exptools system that can subscribe to it, whether or
          not the tool is currently subscribed to.  This allows users
          to know something about tools not currently available, and
          use that information to request of their machine's exptools
          administrator that the given tool be added to the
          subscription list.  It also provides information that allows
          an administrator to decide if a tool is not worth the space
          it requires and should not be subscribed to.

          Only tools available for the given machine type are
          displayed by this command.  Thus, if the command is issued
          on a 3B2 computer, only those optional exptools available to
          3B2 users will be displayed.  Tools available on other
          machine types (such as ibm or vax) but _n_o_t on 3B2's, will
          not be displayed.

          There are four pieces of information displayed about each
          tool.

          This is the name of the tool as found under the _p_r_o_v_i_d_e_r_s
          command and entered into the exptools subscription list.

          This is a short (15 lines or less) description of the tool
          as supplied by the tool's provider.  It should present the
          provider's best sales statement about why someone should
          subscribe to the given tool.  It should _n_o_t be a detailed
          list of tool components nor a lengthy restatement of the
          tool's man page.

          This is the list of the SYNOPSIS sections from all the
          command man pages of the tool.  It provides a short
          indication of the commands the tool makes available to the
          user.

          This is the size of the tool in blocks, as calculated on a
          machine of the same type as the user's machine.  Please
          note, this size may (and probably will) be different on
          different machine types.  In particular, if different
          machine types use different block sizes, this value should
          be very different between those machine types.
