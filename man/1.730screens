          _7_3_0_s_c_r_e_e_n_s is a terminal application that allows acccess to
          the multiple screen capability of the 730 terminal.  Each
          screen is a completely separate workspace for creating
          windows, allowing better organization of tasks and reducing
          overcrowding when many windows are in use.  The number of
          screens allowed is limited only by the memory in the
          terminal.

          Once downloaded to the terminal, _7_3_0_s_c_r_e_e_n_s places a submenu
          on the system button 3 menu.  This allows the user to
          create, destroy, and move among screens.  Screens are
          maintained in a circular list; typing control-space on the
          keyboard switches to the next screen in the list.  A menu
          option allows the user to change to the previous screen.
          New screens are not visible at first, but are created as the
          next screen in the circular list.  Only blank screens may be
          destroyed, so the current screen must have no windows in
          order to be removed.  If the screen is successfully
          destroyed, the display switches to the next screen.  The
          last screen may not be destroyed.

          As the name implies, the multiple screens capability is not
          available in 5620 or 630 terminals.
