     _M_a_c_b_h_c_o_m_b Will take a set of split BinHex files  remove  the
     headers  and  any extra information and restore the original
     single file.  Xbin or some other tool can then  be  used  to
     produce MacIntosh binary files for downloading into a Mac.

     The BinHex files can be piped to macbhcomb and the resulting
     output  will  be written to the standard output.  The header
     and other data will be written to the diagnostic output.

     If macbhcomb is called will a file name it expects the files
     to  be  numbered with the base name plus a '.' followed by a
     number from 1 to n.  The name given will be the output  file
     and all sequential numbered files starting at 1 will be read
     and placed into the output file.  In this mode  the  headers
     and miscellaneous data are written to file name.doc.

     The options to macbhcomb are:

     ----vvvv   Print out file names as files are being processed, will
          also print out final status.

     ----ffff   Force,  causes  macbhcomb  to  overwrite  any  existing
          files.  Normally macbhcomb will print a warning message
          and exit if one of the expected  output  files  already
          exists.

     ----dddd   Used to change the name  of  the  "doc"  file  to  name
          given.

     Any option may be preset by the  environment  variable  MAC-
     BHCOMB.   for  example, by adding the following line to your
     .profile file:

          MACBHCOMB=-v; export MACBHCOMB

     will cause the verbose option to  be  set  automatically  by
     macbhcomb.
