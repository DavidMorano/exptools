DVIPS(1)                 USER COMMANDS                   DVIPS(1)



NAME
     dvips - convert a TeX DVI file to PostScript

SYNOPSIS
     dvips [ _o_p_t_i_o_n_s ] _f_i_l_e[.dvi]

DESCRIPTION
     The program dvips takes a DVI file  _f_i_l_e[.dvi]  produced  by
     TeX  (or  by  some other processor such as GFtoDVI) and con-
     verts it to PostScript, normally sending the result directly
     to  the laserprinter.  The DVI file may be specified without
     the ._d_v_i extension.  Fonts used may either  be  resident  in
     the  printer  or  defined as bitmaps in PK files, or a `vir-
     tual' combination of both.   If  the  MakeTeXPK  program  is
     installed,  dvips will automatically invoke METAFONT to gen-
     erate fonts that don't already exist.

     For more information, see the manual _d_v_i_p_s._t_e_x in the TEXIN-
     PUTS directory. The manual can be printed with the following
     commands:

          tex dvips
          dvips dvips -o dvips.ps
          prt -lpost dvips.ps

OPTIONS
     A summary of command line options can be obtained by running
     dvips  without  a  filename.   For  more  details  refer  to
     _d_v_i_p_s._t_e_x.
