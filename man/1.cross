          The intent of this command is to aid travelers to Manhattan
          deal with one of the trickier problems of getting around,
          i.e., knowing where to find a place based on its avenue
          address.  Since Manhattan avenues begin at different places
          up and down the island, but their addresses usually begin at
          "1" on each avenue, it is very hard to know in advance just
          where to find a place based on its avenue address.

          The Manhattan Yellow Pages and various Manhattan street
          guides try to help in this by publishing algorithms for each
          of the major avenues.  For example, to find the nearest
          cross street on 6th Avenue (The Avenue of the Americas) the
          algorithm is as follows: take the address, cancel the last
          digit, divide by 2, then subtract 12. The resulting number
          is the nearest cross street, give or take a few blocks.
          Needless to say, such algorithms are at best difficult to
          remember.

          The _c_r_o_s_s routine uses such algorithms to provide users such
          cross-street information in a convenient and easy-to-use
          way.

          The arguments to this command are the numeric address and
          avenue name the user would like to know about.  For example,
          to find the (approximate) nearest cross street to AT&T
          Headquarters, the command to issue would be

               cross 550 Madison Avenue

          or even more simply

               cross 550 Madison

          In most cases the word "Avenue" is not needed and is
          ignored.

          A complete listing of the avenues and streets known to this
          command can be obtained by issuing the command "cross list."
          The command "cross help" will print out a brief message
          explaining how to use the command.

          This routine should be of help not only to those AT&T people
          working in the New York area, since they are most likely to
          need such information, but also to AT&T people from other
          areas when they make trips to New York, since their
          knowledge of Manhattan avenues is probably limited.

          The results returned by this command are (hopefully)
          approximate to within one or two blocks.  In addition, most
          of the avenues known to this routine have numeric cross
          streets.  Avenues at the southern end of Manhattan, however,
          have _n_a_m_e_d cross streets and only limited information about
          them is available.

          Another "bug" has to do with the way Manhattan has named its
          avenues.  Several avenues are known by two names.  For
          example the avenue known to most New Yorkers as 6th Avenue
          is listed on maps and company letterheads as Avenue of the
          Americas.  Tenth Avenue becomes Amsterdam Avenue and Eighth
          Avenue becomes Central Park West when they get near Central
          Park.  Similarly, 6th, 7th, and 8th Avenues are renamed to
          Lenox Avenue, Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, and Fredrick
          Douglas Boulevard, respectively, when they enter Harlem.
          Except for a stretch of about 8 blocks, 4th Avenue has been
          completely renamed Park Avenue.
