            The _d_m_d_l_d program downloads the named _f_i_l_e from the host,
            for execution in the 630 MTG terminal's window connected to
            its standard output. It can also be used to invoke cached
            applications.

            The _d_m_d_l_d program works in _l_a_y_e_r_s(_1) and non-layers environ-
            ments.  In _l_a_y_e_r_s(_1), the download runs on top of the exist-
            ing _x_t error-correcting protocol which guarantees the
            integrity of the download.

            In the non-layers environment, _d_m_d_l_d (version 2.0 and later)
            will interrogate the terminal about the medium of the con-
            nection. If the medium is not trustworthy (such as over
            RS232-C connections), _d_m_d_l_d temporarily puts the 630 MTG
            terminal into the _x_t protocol mode, and mimics that protocol
            from its side, thus insuring an error-free download. If the
            medium is inherently trustworthy (such as over the AT&T
            StarLAN network), _d_m_d_l_d will not impose any superfluous pro-
            tocol in order to maximize the download performance. Ver-
            sions of _d_m_d_l_d before version 2.0 do not interrogate the
            terminal and always impose the _x_t protocol even when not
            needed.

            _d_m_d_l_d then asks the terminal if there is a cached applica-
            tion of name _f_i_l_e already in the terminal. The inquiry uses
            the filename clipped from any pathname prefix.  If such an
            application exists and is available, that application will
            be booted in the window without going through the download
            sequence.

            If a cached application of the inquired filename does not
            exist in the terminal or is not available (see _c_a_c_h_e(_3_L) for
            reasons), _d_m_d_l_d will attempt to download _f_i_l_e from the host.
            Files to be downloaded by _d_m_d_l_d must be 630 MTG object files
            created with _d_m_d_c_c(_1).

            During compilation, _d_m_d_c_c(_1) looks for the programming
            environment identification (PEID) number of all the library
            functions link-loaded, and assumes the highest number as the
            PEID of the application. During the download initialization,
            _d_m_d_l_d will send this number to the terminal. If the
            terminal's firmware version does not support this PEID, - in
            other words, the firmware does not have some new library
            functions used by the application- the download will be
            aborted. The argument flag ----ffff will override this checking,

            but the sanity of the application (after being downloaded
            and running) cannot be guaranteed.

            The optional _a_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n-_a_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s are also sent to the ter-
            minal in order to initialize the parameters _a_r_g_c and _a_r_g_v of
            the function _m_a_i_n of the application.

            During the download, the 630 MTG mouse cursor will turn into
            a "coffee cup", and the progress of the download is shown by
            a gradual filling of the window with inverse video.  The
            code to be downloaded is relocated on-the-fly by _d_m_d_l_d to
            the memory area allocated for it by the terminal. If the
            download succeeds, the application will take over the window
            and start execution.

            The following options are supported by _d_m_d_l_d:

            ----dddd   causes a printout of the download information on the
                 diagnostic output (standard error).

            ----pppp   prints non-layers protocol statistics on the diagnostic
                 output (standard error).  Note that this option forces
                 the ----dddd option. In _l_a_y_e_r_s(_1), this option is the same as
                 the ----dddd option.

            ----zzzz   loads the process but does not run it.  The process can
                 then be started using _d_m_d_p_i(1).  This option works only
                 under _l_a_y_e_r_s(1).

            ----mmmm _m_a_x-_p_k_t
                 Set maximum size for the data part of download packets
                 for non-layers downloads.  Legal values are between 16
                 and 120, or 0 for default.  This option also implies
                 that the _x_t-like protocol should be used even though
                 the terminal's initial connection is on an inherently
                 trustworthy network.

            ----xxxx   Force hex encoding mode for standalone downloads even
                 if the terminal does not request it.  This option
                 implies "-m 0".  This option can also be enabled by
                 setting the DMDLOAD environment variable to "hex", for
                 compatibility with an undocumented feature of
                 _l_a_y_e_r_s(_1).

            ----rrrr   Use regular xt protocol for standalone downloads.  This
                 is the same as "-m 0".  This option can also be enabled
                 by setting the DMDLOAD environment variable to "regu-
                 lar".

            ----ffff   forces the download even if the programming environment
                 identification number of the application is not sup-
                 ported by the terminal it is downloaded into.

            ----nnnn   is a null option, and is ignored by _d_m_d_l_d. It is used
                 by processes that want to fork _d_m_d_l_d with a variable
                 argument option.

            ----ZZZZ _n overrides the inherent stack size of the download
                 application and sets it to _n bytes.  _N must be greater
                 than or equal to 2048, or else stack size is defaulted
                 to 2048.  Inherent stack size of the download applica-
                 tion is specified through the -Z option of _d_m_d_c_c(_1) (or
                 defaulted to 2048).


            ----TTTT   loads an absolute file (already link-loaded to a fixed
                 address) such as a new version of the terminal's
                 firmware into the terminal's RAM space.  This download
                 is called a takeover (overlay) download because it will
                 close all physical ports except for the one running
                 _d_m_d_l_d.  The whole terminal screen will turn blank, and
                 will be gradually filled up with inverse video
                 representing the code being downloaded. When the down-
                 load is finished, execution will begin at the first
                 address of _f_i_l_e. Relocation will be done by _d_m_d_l_d only
                 if the first address of _f_i_l_e is lower than the first
                 available RAM address of the terminal. This is neces-
                 sary because low-addressed RAM is used to store the
                 terminal's system tables and variables, and overwriting
                 them with the downloaded data may put the terminal into
                 undetermined states. The ----NNNN option can be used instead,
                 if the relocation possibility is not wanted.

            ----NNNN   loads an absolute file into the terminal's RAM space.
                 The difference between the ----TTTT and ----NNNN options is that
                 the ----NNNN does not relocate the absolute file. Therefore
                 the absolute file can be generated without relocation
                 information.

             ----VVVV  causes _d_m_d_l_d to print a message that identifies which
                 version it is.

            The ----TTTT and ----NNNN options only work in the non-layers environ-
            ment, and are exclusive of each other.

            The environment variable JJJJPPPPAAAATTTTHHHH is the analog of the shell's
            PPPPAAAATTTTHHHH variable to define a set of directories in which to
            search for _f_i_l_e.

            releases have this problem fixed.

            This problem exists when using versions of _d_m_d_l_d before ver-
            sion 2.0: if the _f_i_l_e to be downloaded contains a PEID
            greater than 0 (such as networking applications compiled
            with the 630 Network Development Package's lllliiiibbbbnnnnssssllll____ssss
            library), and the download is done from AT&T 6386 WGSs or
            machines with similar word ordering, the download will be
            wrongly rejected by the terminal due to an incorrect reading
            of the PEID number. _d_m_d_l_d version 2.0 has this problem
            fixed.
