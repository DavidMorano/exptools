          _D_m_d_l_o_c_k allows you to lock a terminal running layers so that
          the terminal can be left unattended but logged on.  To
          unlock the terminal, you must correctly enter a password.  A
          menu on button 3 allows you to choose between a login pass-
          word or a newly typed password, and to choose between mouse
          or keyboard based triggering.

          If no password is specified by the parameter list, _d_m_d_l_o_c_k
          will prompt for one after it has downloaded.  The password
          will not be displayed as it is typed; however, a backspace
          will delete a character and an at-sign (@) will kill the
          entire line.  You will be asked to verify the password by
          re-typing it.

          When the ----pppp option is specified, _d_m_d_l_o_c_k creates a private
          password file (.dmd.lock) to hold an encrypted login pass-
          word, and exits. When present, the .dmd.lock password is
          used in place of any /etc/passwd file entry.

          Your login password (found in /etc/passwd or .dmd.lock) is
          used automatically when you use the ----uuuu option.  This over-
          rides the default action of prompting for a newly typed
          password.  If your login password cannot be obtained for
          some reason (i.e. /etc/private has been installed and
          .dmd.lock doesn't exist), and you have used the ----uuuu option,
          _d_m_d_l_o_c_k will fail with an error message, and will suggest
          that you run _d_m_d_l_o_c_k with the ----pppp option first.

          When the ----cccc option is used, _d_m_d_l_o_c_k will cache the dmdlock
          in memory so the layer can be deleted, and accessed later
          using the Button 3 "other" menu.  (MTG 630 only)

          When the ----llll option is used, _d_m_d_l_o_c_k selects the moused based
          trigger. The default is keyboard based locking.  Mouse based
          triggering works by locking the terminal whenever the
          _d_m_d_l_o_c_k layer is selected. Keyboard based triggering locks
          the terminal whenever the _d_m_d_l_o_c_k layer is current and the
          return key is pressed.

          When the ----LLLL option is used, mouse based triggering is
          selected, and the terminal is locked immediately when down-
          load into the current layer, or when accessed via the button

          3 "other" menu (see ----cccc above.)

          When the ----bbbb option is specified, the screen will blank on
          locking. The screen will restore when the terminal is
          unlocked.  (MTG 630 only)

          The ----aaaa option is used to specify the autolock timeout period
          in minutes.  Dmdlock locks the terminal automatically when-
          ever the terminal remains inactive for a period of time
          exceeding the timeout period.  The default timeout period is
          15 minutes;  this is also the maximum allowable setting.
          Specifing a timeout period of 0 disables automatic locking.
          The keyboard will sound a tone when the countdown is in its
          last minute.  (MTG 630 only)

          The ----AAAA option works like the ----aaaa option, but the countdown is
          suppressed till the last minute.

          _D_m_d_l_o_c_k only runs under layers.  The ----pppp option will invoke
          the C compiler, and hence will only run on machines that
          have the cc(1) command installed.  It is unsafe to provide
          the password via the command line; Command line arguments
          can be viewed by other users using the ps command.

          _D_m_d_l_o_c_k doesn't know about your stty(1) erase/kill charac-
          ters.  When running the dmdlock command on a terminal where
          a dmdlock process is cached, the dmdlock command arguments
          are ignored, and the cached ones are used instead.

          On old 630 terminal upgraded with a LAN board and an X win-
          dows cartridge, harware bus noise sometimes wreaks havok on
          dmdlock's crypt function. The only known work around is to
          not use the -u option (or to get a newer terminal).
