	  _I_n_e_d_i_t is a general purpose input editor that	gives edit
	  shell	editing	features to most any command.

	  If -e	is specified, an exit-cmd must also be specified.  In
	  this case, when inedit exits it will execute the exit-cmd.
	  In most cases, the exit-cmd will need	to be specified	in
	  either single	or double quotes.

	  If -s	is specified, a	start-file must	also be	specified.  In
	  this case the	lines of the file will be inserted into	the
	  input	stream before the keyboard is read.  See METERING
	  section.

	  Normally each	line is	simply entered followed	by a new-line
	  ('RETURN' or 'LINE FEED').  At any point while entering a
	  line from a terminal,	if 'echo' mode (see stty(1)) is
	  active, the user has the option to edit the line.  To	edit,
	  the user moves the cursor to the point needing correction
	  and then inserts or deletes characters or words as needed.

	  Many of the editing commands are control characters or
	  escape sequences.  The notation for control characters is
	  caret	(^) followed by	the character.	For example, ^F	is the
	  notation for control F.  This	is entered by depressing 'f'
	  while	holding	down the "CTRL"	(control) key.	The "SHIFT"
	  key is _n_o_t depressed (^f would be a better notation, but the
	  convention is	^F).  (The notation ^? indicates the DEL
	  (delete) key.)

	  The notation for escape sequences is M- followed by a
	  character.  For example, M-f (pronounced Meta	f) is entered
	  by depressing	ESC (escape) followed by 'f'.  (M-F would be
	  the notation for ESC followed	by "SHIFT" (capital) 'F'.)

	  All edit commands operate from any place on the line (not
	  just at the beginning).  Neither the "RETURN"	nor the	"LINE
	  FEED"	key is entered after edit commands except when noted.

	  The editing features require that the	user's terminal	accept
	  "RETURN" as carriage return without line feed	and that a
	  space	(' ') must overwrite the current character on the
	  screen.  ADM terminal	users should set the "space - advance"
	  switch to 'space'.  Hewlett-Packard series 2621 terminal

	  There	are two	editing	modes: emacs and vi. _I_n_e_d_i_t will come

	  _e_r_a_s_e	    (User defined erase	character as defined by	the

	  _k_i_l_l	    (User defined kill character as defined by the

	  In many cases	when using a start-file	you will have to meter
	  the rate the start-file is processed.	 For example, to have
	  the start-file call the editor (/bin/ed) and then have the
	  start-file supply editor commands, if	the start-file
	  contains only:

	   cd /etc
	   ed /etc/passwd
	   g/root/p

	  you'll get a message indicating g/root/p was not found.  If
	  however, your	start-file contains:

	   cd /etc
	   ed /etc/passwd
	   !PAUSE 6
	   g/root/p

	  the entry for	root will be found and printed.

	  The problem is that without the !PAUSE, the lines after a
	  program (such	as the editor) is entered will be processed by
	  the shell rather than	the desired program.  The !PAUSE
	  causes a delay so that the desired program will get these
	  lines	rather than the	shell.	The number, is the number of
	  seconds of the delay.	 Values	of 1 to	60 are valid.  Values
	  outside this range are converted to 60.

	  Inedit, to locate the	cursor,	issues a new line when the
	  first	character of each line is entered.

	  Commands that	put the	tty port in the	raw mode (e.g. vi,
	  emacs, more) can not be run through inedit.  However,	they
	  can be executed as an	escaped	(!) command.  Example:

	  !emacs file

	  Several VI commands are unimplemented, notably u,U,.,f, and
	  F.
