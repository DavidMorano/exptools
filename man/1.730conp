	    _7_3_0_c_o_n_p provides the ability to route the data on one host
	    connection on the 730 no another.  The obvious use for this
	    is to allow	you to connect a PC or terminal	to the serial
	    port on the	730 terminal and then connect that serial port
	    to a starlan or IDM	(ISDN Data Module) host	connection.
	    This eliminates the	need for a serial/RS232	connection for
	    the	PC or other terminal.  By default, _7_3_0_c_o_n_p will	connect
	    the	main port (physical host 0) to the next	available IDM
	    host (physical host	6).

	    The	options	recognized by _7_3_0_c_o_n_p are listed below.	 The
	    term hhhhoooosssstttt ccccoooonnnnnnnneeeeccccttttiiiioooonnnn refers	to the name of the device that
	    provides a type of interface to a remote host.  Examples of
	    hhhhoooosssstttt ccccoooonnnnnnnneeeeccccttttiiiioooonnnn names are:

	    and	to-host, is directly related to	the use	of 'from' and
	    'to' in the	option names.  I.e.  ----sssshhhhoooowwwwffffrrrroooommmm means show the

	    fied, and ----sssshhhhoooowwwwttttoooo means show the output comming from the

	    All	options	which are boolean flags	can have 'nnnnoooo' in front
	    of the option name to mean the negative of the boolean (e.g.
	    -noshowfrom).  The default is for all of these options to be
	    off.

	    If you use the terminal as a baudrate matcher be aware that
	    sustained data transfers where the sending device is faster
	    than the receiving device can result in lost data if flow
	    control is not handled by the sending device.  Make	sure
	    that the rcvflow and sendflow options are enabled on both

	    trol.

	    You	will probably want the 730 ports associated with the
	    connections	to be set to 8 bits no parity, to allow	tran-
	    sparent data transfer.

	    The	window provided	by _7_3_0_c_o_n_p is not a wproc+ window.  This
	    means that it is not generally useful as a window to work
	    in.	 It is intended	that this window just provides con-
	    vienent status information showing that the	connection is in
	    fact active.

	    You	must use the Exit menu to exit out of one side of the
	    connection.

	    it disconnects from	the current host/window	and if you are

	    host.  The terminal	firmware has a check for this condition
	    and	will abort the _a_t_t_a_c_h(_3) request.
