     _M_a_c_x_b_i_n converts a file created  by  BinHex  (usually  named
     with  one  of the extensions ".hex", ".hcx", or ".hqx") into
     three host-system files suitable for downloading to a Macin-
     tosh  via macput.  This program is designed for use with the
     1.1 Release version of MacTerminal, but includes a  compati-
     bility option for the old -0.15X Almost-Alpha version.

     The ----llll (list) option reads the header information and prints
     out  all  the useful information there, without creating any
     converted output files.

     The ----xxxx option causes macxbin to create a MacBinary  file  (a
     single  file  with  ".BIN"  for an extension) instead of the
     usual three files.

     The ----vvvv (verbose) option prints a line for each  file  to  be
     converted, indicating the input and output file names.

     The ----nnnn name option allows the user to specify  the  name  to
     use  when  creating  the host files and the eventual name to
     use on the mac.  This option must  precede  the  input  file
     name it is to affect.

     If this option is not used, the names will be  derived  from
     either the input file name (.hex or .hcx files), or the name
     encoded in the header information (.hqx files).  Spaces  and
     slashes  will  be  converted  to  underscores,  and the .h?x
     extension will be deleted, if one is included in  the  input
     file name.

     The ----ffff option will cause macxbin to  overwrite  an  existing
     output  file.  If it is not set macxbin will simply print an
     error message and abort.

     A file name of "-" indicates that the input should be  taken
     from  stdin.   If no mac file name is specified, the default
     name (for .hex or .hcx files) is "stdin".

     Mail or news headers and signatures  need  not  be  manually
     stripped  --  macxbin  will  ignore  pretty much anything it
     doesn't need.

MACXBIN(1)                User Commands                MACXBIN(1)



     _m_a_c_x_b_i_n creates three  host-system  files  from  each  input
     file:  _n_a_m_e....iiiinnnnffffoooo, _n_a_m_e....ddddaaaattttaaaa, and _n_a_m_e....rrrrssssrrrrcccc.

     The ----oooo flag specifies  "old"  (version  -0.15X)  MacTerminal
     compatibility mode.

     Any option may be preset by the environment  variable  MACX-
     BIN.   for  example,  by  adding  the following line to your
     .profile file:

          MACXBIN=-x; export MACXBIN

     will cause macxbin to write out a MacBinary file by default.

     If arguments are given on the command line  the  environment
     is ignored.

     The "LOCKED" bit in the flags  cannot  be  set  by  macxbin.
     This  is  due  to a bug in MacTerminal, which sets the flags
     when the file is created, rather  than  after  it  has  been
     transferred,  resulting  in  it  not being able to write the
     file.

     Input files must contain a line starting with  "(This  file"
     to detect the beginning of the BinHex information.
