            _7_3_0_p_r_t causes the named file to be printed on the printer
            named _p_r_i_n_t_e_r. If no names appear, the standard input is
            assumed; thus _7_3_0_p_r_t may be used as a filter.

            Note that _7_3_0_p_r_t understands special control/escape
            sequences for printing.  The OOOONNNNLLLLYYYY control/escape sequences
            that are allowed are:

                   above, the length and width will adjust to the par-
                   ticular pitch's defaults.  Note that the margin and

                   Also, options like numbering, formatting, and file

                   Forces the print defaults for _p_r_i_n_t_e_r.  Available
                   printers include _5_3_1_0/_5_3_2_0, _a_p_p_l_e, _d_e_s_k_j_e_t, _e_p_s_o_n,

                   _e_r_i_c printer specifier and other printers will be
                   added on request.
            ----WWWW _s_e_c_o_n_d_s
                   Enables the printer wait timer.  When the timer is
                   enabled, the system waits for _s_e_c_o_n_d_s whenever the
                   number of characters sent to the printer reaches a
                   threshold.  This is required to prevent a printer
                   buffer overflow in some situations; see "FLOW CON-

            ----pppp _p_i_t_c_h
                   Forces the printer to use _p_i_t_c_h as the font size.
                   Some font substitutions may occur (printer dependent)
                   and a warning message will be generated.
            ----mmmm _m_a_r_g_i_n

            ----wwww _w_i_d_t_h
                   Formats the output to consume _w_i_d_t_h characters per
                   page.  Note that the width includes 6 spaces for
                   numbering (if activated) and the margin.
            ----tttt _h_t_a_b
                   Expand horizontal tabs to consume _h_t_a_b spaces per

            ----vvvv _v_t_a_b

            ----oooo _o_u_t_f_i_l_e
                   Use _o_u_t_f_i_l_e as the destination instead of the 730
                   printer.
            ----iiii _i_n_f_i_l_e
                   Use _i_n_f_i_l_e as the file for printing. This option
                   allows the input file to be specified with other
                   options to follow.

            Most problems seem to occur in this area.  The 730 AUX port
            does not support Clear to Send / Request to Send (CTS/RTS)
            hardware handshaking so print buffer overflows tend to
            occur.  This can result because of two reasons:

            +o  dot matrix printers can support receiving data at rates
               faster than the print head can physically move across the
               page (ie: you may have the printer set for 9600 baud, but
               the printer may only be able print the equivalent of 40
               characters per second)

            +o  the host may be sending the data at a rate higher than
               the printer is receiving data (ie: the printer is at a
               slower speed than the terminal to host connection).

            There are three solutions to this problem: 1) Have the pro-
            gram wait periodically for the printer to "catch up," 2) Use
            XON/XOFF protocol and support a software handshake, or 3)
            Run Layers(1) and have the terminal to host connection run
            an additional protocol above all lower protocols.  The deci-
            sion was made to support all options.

            The first possibility is to use the -_W option for 730prt,
            that will wait for 0-120 seconds whenever 1024 characters
            are printed.  The problem with this implementation is that
            some printers can print faster/slower than this rate and the
            printer may "pause" several times during a print job, or
            worse yet, still experience a buffer overflow.

            The second possibility is to use XON/XOFF and let the
            printer tell the host that its buffer is about to overflow.
            This is a good solution but can have several problems.  A
            bizzare configuration (that I happen to use!!!) is shown
            below:


                 |-----|   |------|   |----|   |-------|   |-----|   |-----|
                 | SUN |---| ISDN |---| DK |---| MODEM |---| 730 |---| PRT |
                 |-----| 9 |------| 9 |----| 2 |-------| 2 |-----| 9 |-----|
                         6          6        4           4         6
                         0          0        0           0         0

9
            In the scenario above, the following must be set (from left
            to right):

            +o  The host must use XON/XOFF protocol and support RTS/CTS
               protocol: [stty ixon ixoff crtscts].

            +o  The ISDN CPE must propagate the XON/XOFF flow control
               from the printer; this is automatic.  However, the CPE
               must NOT generate XON/XOFF if its internal buffers begin
               to overflow.  It should use RTS/CTS instead to work in
               layers or non-layers environments: [set rec.flow eia] and
               [set trans.flow eia].

            +o  Datakit must be conditioned to ignore flow control, but
               must be aware that the device supports flow control:
               [set dkfc none] and [set fc xon].

            +o  The printer must have its option switches set to generate
               an XON/XOFF when its receive buffer is full/empty:
               [s3 closed on APPLEWRITER].

               Finally, Layers(1) can be used, but for the application
               listed above, this slows down the screen paint time by a
               noticeable amount.  The user is forewarned about the
               various considerations, but it is up to you...

            In reality, the filter escape could be incorrectly set to

            such as VITERM(EXPTOOLS) or EMACSTERM(EXPTOOLS) would
            correctly filter the printer initialization escape sequences
            (not desirable) during a screen dump.

            As outline in the 730+ Multitasking Graphics Terminal User's
            Guide [Overview 1-8, 1-9], there are special hardware
            requirements to make the printer interface work correctly; a
            standard datakit cable and connector will not work!!!  You
            need to order some of the follow items:

            If printer pitches are substituted in the middle of a file,
            changes can be made to the default length or width. In gen-
            eral, it is not recommended that users change pitches in the
            middle of a line - put a pitch change on a line by itself!

            The program also cannot handle differences in pitch prop-
            erly. This is a print driver, not a word processor!  The is
            no provision that larger pitches take up more space - a
            character is a character no matter how wide it really is.
            The same is true for headline vs. normal modes.

            Since the 730+ "4014 GS" terminal emulation package does not
            support a printer activation escape sequence, this program
            will not work using that window type.  The program requires

            a terminal emulator that supports wproc+ capabilities.

            The interface for the laserjet has yet to be tested.
