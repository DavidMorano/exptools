	  _T_d_c is a program that	generates completed Telephone Reim-
	  bursement Program forms and prints them on a
	  PostScript(Reg.) printer.  The form generated	is the
	  _G_N-_9_2-_6_0_0, as	used by	the Atlanta Payroll organization.  If
	  you are served by a different	payroll	organization, you
	  should check with them to see	which TDC form that organiza-
	  tion expects you to use.

	  You will need	to print the form, get it signed, and make
	  copies for yourself, your supervisor,	and the	payroll
	  department.  The form	produced by _t_d_c	looks very much	like
	  the GN-92-600	forms available	in the stockroom.  _T_d_c is a
	  shell	script that uses _k_s_h(1).

	  Optionally, _t_d_c can save a copy of the data that you enter
	  in the .tdcrecord file in your $HOME directory.

	  The first time you use _t_d_c you will be prompted for fixed
	  personal information to appear on every form you fill	out.
	  This includes

	       your Home Telephone Number,
	       the last	8 digits of your Universal Card	Number,
	       your Last Name, First Name, and Middle Initial,
	       your Social Security Number,
	       your Organization Number,
	       your Work Address,
	       your Office Phone Number,
	  and
	       your Weekly/Monthly pay period status.

	  This information is stored in	the file ._G_N_9_2-_6_0_0_v_o_u_c_h	in
	  your $HOME directory,	so that	when you run _t_d_c again you
	  need not re-enter this information.  To change it you	can
	  either edit the ._G_N_9_2-_6_0_0_v_o_u_c_h file or remove	it.  If	you
	  remove it, then _t_d_c will ask you for the information the
	  next time you	run the	program.

	  After	this initial information, _t_d_c will prompt you for the
	  additional information needed	to fill	out each line of the
	  form.

	  For each month and year for which you	are filling out	the
	  form,	_t_d_c will ask for

	       other AT&T telephone charges,
	  and
	       voucherable and private business	calls
	       included	in the above amounts.

	  _T_d_c will calculate the two columns that are derived from the
	  input	data and tell you what the numbers come	out to,	then
	  it will go on	to the next billing month.  When you have run
	  out of room on the form (the GN-92-600 form only has 12
	  lines	on it) or you have run out of input data and hit
	  return without entering a billing month, _t_d_c generates the
	  PostScript code and sends it to the printer.

	  The first time you print your	TDC form with _t_d_c, it will ask
	  you to specify what command to use to	send postscript	data
	  to your local	printer.  This print command could be a	com-
	  mand that knows implicitly what printer to use, or it	could
	  be a command that requires an	argument to specify the	desti-
	  nation printer.

	  If your printer command requires an argument,	and that argu-
	  ment is in the form "-d destination",	you can	leave the
	  argument off the printer command, and	give the printer des-
	  tination name	in response to the next	prompt,	which asks you
	  for the name of the printer.

	       Example:
		   Printer command: prt	-lpost
		   Printer name:    myprinter

	  If your printer command requires an argument,	but the	argu-
	  ment is not like "-d destination", specify the argument as
	  part of the printer command, and enter return	at the printer
	  name prompt without entering a printer name.

	       Example:
		   Printer command: lpr	-Pmyprinter
		   Printer name:

	  If your printer command always goes to the same printer, and
	  does not require any arguments, leave	the printer name
	  empty.

	       Example:
		   Printer command: local_postscript_printer_command
		   Printer name:

	  ----cccc	  This option can be used to specify the number	of
		  copies of the	form to	be printed.  A value of	3
		  could	be used, for examples, to provide one copy for
		  yourself and two to submit.

	  ----rrrr	  This option is used to rerun a previously entered
		  tdc using the	last entry stored in the
		  $HOME/.tdcrecord file.  Typically this would done
		  after	editing	the entry to make corrections.	The
		  implementation of this is fairly crude:  Currently
		  only the last	entry can be reprinted (there is no
		  option to select any other entry), and there is no
		  validation or	other error checking of	the data in
		  the file.  Only the input data required by the pro-
		  gram is read from the	file.  The totals will be
		  recalculated for the printout, but the data file is
		  not updated, so it is	possible for the two to	be
		  inconisistent	if the file is not edited correctly.

	  ----ffff	  This option allows you to specify a file name	for
		  storing personal data.  Typically, this would	be
		  used when the	user needs to generate forms for
		  several people.  By default, personal	data is	stored
		  in $HOME/.GN92-600vouch.  If "-f name" is provided
		  then the data	will be	stored in $HOME/.GN92-600name.

	  _T_d_c is updated each time that	a new version of the GN-92-600
	  form is issued.  Each	time that _t_d_c has changed, the data
	  stored in the	$HOME/.GN92-600vouch file has had to change
	  too.	When you run _t_d_c, it will try to detect	if your
	  $HOME/.GN92-600vouch file contains data from an older	ver-
	  sion of _t_d_c, and if this situation is	discovered, it will
	  try to make the necessary changes, where possible, to	the
	  old data contained in	the $HOME/.GN92-600vouch file to make
	  it work with the current version of _t_d_c.

	  If _t_d_c has to	do this, it will warn you with a message
	  explaining what has happened,	and then the form will be
	  printed with the converted data.  If the form	does not come
	  out correctly, then _t_d_c may not have been able to success-
	  fully	convert	the data, and you should either

	       manually	edit the $HOME/.GN92-600vouch file to make the
	       necessary corrections,
	  or
