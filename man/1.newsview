          _N_e_w_s_v_i_e_w is a screen-oriented program that can be used to
          read news items from one or more news directories.  These
          directories are typically writable by all users, and provide
          a forum for the exchange of local news or project-related
          information.  The most common such directory is ////uuuussssrrrr////nnnneeeewwwwssss
          and is used to inform users of system-related matters, such
          as machine down-time or the installation of new software.
          The most common program used to read this type of news is
          the System V _n_e_w_s command.

          While the System V _n_e_w_s program lets all of the news scroll
          off your screen, _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w shows you a list of the news
          items, tells you which ones you have not read, and lets you
          page through each item one at a time, using a built-in pager
          similar to the exptools _l_e_s_s program.

        OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss
          _N_e_w_s_v_i_e_w accepts the following command-line options:

          ----VVVV            Display the _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w version ID and exit.

          ----dddd            Display the default news directories and
                        default print command, then exit.

          ----eeee            Exit immediately of there are no new news
                        items to read.

          ----llll            List the number of new news items (if any) in
                        each directory, then exit.

          ----nnnn_n_e_w_s_p_a_t_h    Override the default NEWSPATH by specifying
                        one or more directories, separated by colons.

          If you do not use the ----nnnn option, _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w will read the
          NEWSPATH variable from your environment.  If NEWSPATH is not
          set, a system-wide default will be used.  Here is an example
          of how to set up your NEWSPATH in your .profile:

               NEWSPATH=/usr/news:$TOOLS/lib/toolnews:/local/project/news
               export NEWSPATH

          _N_e_w_s_v_i_e_w has three types of screens: the main directory
          menu, the file list screen, and the file display screen.
          The first two screens display lists of directories and
          files.  In each of these screens one entry will be
          highlighted in reverse-video.  You can move up and down the
          list using arrow keys and other control keys described
          below.  Pressing the RETURN key will select the entry that
          is currently highlighted.  You can also select an entry by
          typing its number.

          The main menu lists the directories in your NEWSPATH, or
          those you specified with the ----nnnn option.  The number of "new"
          items (items you have not yet read) and the total number of
          items in each directory will also be displayed on this
          screen.  Selecting a directory will bring you to the "list"
          screen for that directory.  Alternatively, if you type the
          "r" command, you will automatically be put into the
          "display" screen for the next news item that you have not
          yet read.

          The "list" screen lists the names of the news items in one
          news directory.  You can page or scroll through this list,
          read items from this directory, or enter other commands as
          described below.

          When you read a news item, you are put into the "display"
          screen for that item.  From there, you can page or scroll
          through the item, read other items, or enter other commands
          as described below.

          Most _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w commands are single keystrokes and do not
          require you to hit RETURN.  Exceptions to this are entering
          a number, a search string, or a file name.  Some keys are
          defined for all three types of screens.  Others are only
          recognized in the "list" or "display" screens.  In the
          following descriptions, the notation "^A" represents the
          character "<Ctrl-A>":

          These commands may be used in all three types of screens:

          SPACE       Move forward one page in the screen.  In the
                      directory or list screens, this will display the
                      next page of directory or file names.  In the
                      display screen, this will display the next page
                      of the current file.  If a search string is
                      defined, in the display screen SPACE brings the
                      next occurrence of the search string to the top
                      of the screen (see SSSSeeeeaaaarrrrcccchhhh ccccoooommmmmmmmaaaannnnddddssss below).

          ^F          Same as SPACE, except that if a search string is
                      defined, in the display screen ^F will not
                      perform a search the way SPACE does.

          ^B or b     Move backward one page in the screen.

          ^D or d     Scroll down half a page.

          ^U or u     Scroll up half a page.

          These commands may be used in the list screen and display
          screen:

          r         Read the next item that you have not yet read.
                    The list screen will display the word "Unread"
                    next to any item whose timestamp is newer than
                    that of the latest item you have read.  See FILES

                    which holds the timestamps for each news
                    directory.

          n         Read the next item (sequentially) in the current
                    directory.

          p         Read the previous item (sequentially) in the
                    current directory.

          t         Read the current item.  From the list screen, this
                    is the same as pressing RETURN.  From the display
                    screen, this will re-read the current item from
                    the beginning (or "top").

          These commands may be used in the list screen and display
          screen:

          s         Save an item in a file.  You can specify a file
                    name to be created using its full path name, or a
                    name relative to the directory from which you
                    entered _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w.  If you provide a directory name
                    only, a file will be created in that directory
                    using the name of the news item.

          *         Print an item.  The news item will be piped to the
                    command you specify by your NEWSPRINT environment
                    variable.  If this variable is not set, a system-
                    wide default command will be used.

          |         Pipe an item to a shell command.  You enter a
                    shell command, and _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w will pipe the item to
                    that command.

          m         Send mail to the owner of an item.  You will be
                    placed in an editor defined by your EDITOR
                    environment variable, if set.  The default editor
                    is _v_i. The mail message will automatically include
                    the text of the news item, which you can edit or
                    remove completely before sending the mail.  You
                    can also change the mail recipients by editing the
                    "To:" line.  This is useful, for example, when
                    sending mail to an _e_x_p_t_o_o_l_s provider, since all
                    _e_x_p_t_o_o_l_s news items are owned by the _e_x_p_t_o_o_l_s
                    login, and it would not be appropriate to address
                    your mail to that login.

                    you are in the list screen, only those files that
                    contain the search string will appear in your

                    at the top of the display.  Whatever search string
                    you enter from "list" will be used in "display"

                    treat upper and lower case characters differently.
                    Pressing "i" again will revert to ignoring case

          The file ....nnnneeeewwwwssssvvvviiiieeeewwww in your HOME directory is created and
          maintained by _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w.  This file contains one line for
          each news directory that _n_e_w_s_v_i_e_w has encountered.  Each
          line consists of the name of the news directory, followed by
          a TAB, followed by the timestamp of the last item you have
          read in that directory.  Here is what a typical ....nnnneeeewwwwssssvvvviiiieeeewwww
          file might look like:

               /usr/add-on/exptools/lib/toolnews       699657375
               /local/project/news           699656341

          This is an ASCII file that you can edit.  For example, if
          one of your news directories is moved to a different place,
          but the files under that directory are preserved, you may
          want to edit your ....nnnneeeewwwwssssvvvviiiieeeewwww file and change the directory
          name.  The timestamps are stored as the number of seconds
          since January 1, 1970 (which is the standard UNIX time
          format), so you should probably not modify that value unless
          you know what you are doing.
