          Since GNU Emacs (gnuemacs) is large(est of all the exptools
          (as of 10/1991)), it is an "optionally installed" exptool.
          If it is not already installed on your machine, please
          request installation from the exptools gnuemacs providers.
          You can get our current names from the exptools' "providers"
          command.  [The "ruginfo" command can be used to check the
          health of your machine's link with the exptools network.]

          The name _e_m_a_c_s was already taken as an exptool name, so we
          have called this program _g_n_u_e_m_a_c_s, and altered this manual
          page's headers to reflect that.  When reading any GNU Emacs
          documentation, such as the remainder of this manual page,
          please remember that to invoke the exptool GNU Emacs you
          must use the name "gnuemacs".

          There is a "tips directory" in which we have placed various
          chit-chat on the workings of exptools gnuemacs in our
          environment: $TOOLS/lib/gnuemacs/local/tips (TOOLS=`logdir
          exptools`).  Please look there for various caveats etc. (in
          fact, some parts you may be required to read).  In order to
          reduce our maintenance effort, all information as to how the
          exptools version acts differently than that described in the
          standard GNU Emacs distribution's documentation will be
          placed there, including items superseding this manual page.
          If you have any questions about GNU Emacs after looking in
          our "tips" directory, or perhaps can't find our tips
          directory, you can contact us.

          To find out who we, the gnuemacs exptool providers,
          currently are, do "providers gnuemacs".  As of 10/1991 we
          are Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM, Scott_F_Thompson@ATT.COM, and
          Charles_A_Webb@ATT.COM (Chip).  By the way, "toolnews
          gnuemacs" may display additional information.

          Though the following is from the GNU Emacs version 18.57
          manual page (with date unaltered), we are not necessarily
          using version 18.57 across all architectures.  The startup
          screen or "(emacs-version)" command within gnuemacs will
          tell you the current version.

          And now we resume the original manual text (warning: the
          paths described under FILES below are not the same as in our
          exptool version, of course.  Also, on some versions we have
          not compiled in X Windows support)...

          _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s is a new version of _E_m_a_c_s, written by the author
          of the original (PDP-10) _E_m_a_c_s, Richard Stallman. Its user
          functionality encompasses everything other _E_m_a_c_s editors do,
          and it is easily extensible since its editing commands are
          written in Lisp.

          _E_m_a_c_s has an extensive interactive help facility, but the
          facility assumes that you know how to manipulate _E_m_a_c_s
          windows and buffers.  CTRL-h (backspace or CTRL-h) enters
          the Help facility.  Help Tutorial (CTRL-h t) requests an
          interactive tutorial which can teach beginners the
          fundamentals of _E_m_a_c_s in a few minutes.  Help Apropos
          (CTRL-h a) helps you find a command given its functionality,
          Help Character (CTRL-h c) describes a given character's
          effect, and Help Function (CTRL-h f) describes a given Lisp
          function specified by name.

          _E_m_a_c_s'_s Undo can undo several steps of modification to your
          buffers, so it is easy to recover from editing mistakes.

          _G_N_U _E_m_a_c_s'_s many special packages handle mail reading
          (RMail) and sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline),
          compiling (Compile), running subshells within _E_m_a_c_s windows
          (Shell), running a Lisp read-eval-print loop (Lisp-
          Interaction-Mode), and automated psychotherapy (Doctor).

          There is an extensive reference manual, but users of other
          Emacses should have little trouble adapting even without a
          copy.  Users new to _E_m_a_c_s will be able to use basic features
          fairly rapidly by studying the tutorial and using the self-
          documentation features.

          Emacs Options

          The following options are of general interest:

          _f_i_l_e    Edit _f_i_l_e.

          ++++_n_u_m_b_e_r Go to the line specified by _n_u_m_b_e_r (do not insert a
                  space between the "+" sign and the number).

          ----qqqq      Do not load an init file.

          ----uuuu _u_s_e_r Load _u_s_e_r'_s init file.

          ----tttt _f_i_l_e Use specified _f_i_l_e as the terminal instead of using
                  stdin/stdout.  This must be the first argument
                  specified in the command line.

          The following options are lisp-oriented (these options are
          processed in the order encountered):

                  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_f_i_l_e. The editor will send messages to
                  stdout.  This option must be the first in the
                  argument list.

          Using Emacs with X

          _E_m_a_c_s has been tailored to work well with the X window
          system.  If you run _E_m_a_c_s from under X windows, it will
          create its own X window to display in.  You will probably
          want to start the editor as a background process so that you
          can continue using your original window.

          _E_m_a_c_s can be started with the following X switches:

          ----rrrrnnnn _n_a_m_e
                  Specifies the program name which should be used when
                  looking up defaults in the user's X resources.  This
                  must be the first option specified in the command
                  line.

          ----wwwwnnnn _n_a_m_e
                  Specifies the name which should be assigned to the
                  _E_m_a_c_s window.

          ----rrrr      Display the _E_m_a_c_s window in reverse video.

          ----iiii      Use the "kitchen sink" bitmap icon when iconifying
                  the _E_m_a_c_s window.

          ----ffffoooonnnntttt _f_o_n_t, ----ffffnnnn _f_o_n_t
                  Set the _E_m_a_c_s window's font to that specified by
                  _f_o_n_t. You will find the various _X fonts in the
                  /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_X_1_1/_f_o_n_t_s directory.  Note that _E_m_a_c_s will
                  only accept fixed width fonts.  Under the X11
                  Release 4 font-naming conventions, any font with the
                  value "m" or "c" in the eleventh field of the font
                  name is a fixed width font.  Furthermore, fonts
                  whose name are of the form _w_i_d_t_hx_h_e_i_g_h_t are
                  generally fixed width, as is the font _f_i_x_e_d.  See
                  _x_l_s_f_o_n_t_s(1) for more information.

                  When you specify a font, be sure to put a space
                  between the switch and the font name.

          reporting something as a bug, please try to be sure that it
          really is a bug, not a misunderstanding or a deliberate
          feature.  We ask you to read the section ``Reporting Emacs
          Bugs'' near the end of the reference manual (or Info system)
          for hints on how and when to report bugs.  Also, include the
          version number of the Emacs you are running in _e_v_e_r_y bug
          report that you send in.

          Do not expect a personal answer to a bug report.  The
          purpose of reporting bugs is to get them fixed for everyone
          in the next release, if possible.  For personal assistance,
          look in the SERVICE file (see above) for a list of people
          who offer it.

          Please do not send anything but bug reports to this mailing
          list.  Send requests to be added to mailing lists to the
          special list info-gnu-emacs-request@prep.ai.mit.edu (or the
          corresponding UUCP address).  For more information about
          Emacs mailing lists, see the file
          /usr/local/emacs/etc/MAILINGLISTS [which also discusses
          relevant USENET "netnews" groups -Dan J 10/91].  Bugs tend
          actually to be fixed if they can be isolated, so it is in
          your interest to report them in such a way that they can be
          easily reproduced.

          Bugs that I know about are: shell will not work with
          programs running in Raw mode on some Unix versions.
