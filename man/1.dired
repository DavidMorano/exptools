          Dired is a version of the emacs editor that allows a user to
          edit  the contents of a directory.  A "ls -l" listing of the
          directory is displayed on the screen, and emacs commands for
          searching  and cursor movement can be used to move around in
          the display.  The following commands behave  differently  in
          emacs and are used for special purposes.

          ^? or ^H:       Mark the current file for deletion

          D, D:           If the cursor is in column 1, mark the current file
                          for deletion.  Otherwise, they just overwrite what
                          is there.

          U, u:           If the cursor is in column 1, unmark the current
                          file, otherwise overwrite what is there.

          e:              If the cursor is in column 1, then edit the current
                          entry with emacs or dired depending on whether it is
                          a file or directory.  Exiting with ^Z will return to
                          where you left off.

          Ordinary emacs editing commands can be used  to  modify  the
          owner,  group,  and mode fields of the display.  You are put
          in overwrite mode, so that as you type  over  a  field,  the
          characters  you type replace what is there.  DIRED will mark
          files whose modes have been modified  with  'M',  and  files
          with  modified  owner  with  'O'.  Once marked, a file stays
          marked.  You can cause DIRED to ignore a change by overwrit-
          ing the 'M' or 'O'.

          When you exit, a list of marked files will be displayed, and
          you  will  be  asked whether or not they are OK for editing.
          Next to each file will appear a 'D' if the  file  is  to  be
          deleted,  'O'  if the owner and group are being modified, or
          'M' if the mode is being  modified.   If  you  type  'y'  or
          space,  the  files will be edited as described.  If you type
          ^G, dired will skip all edits to that  directory  and  exit.
          Typing 'n' returns you to the buffer display.

          Most of the usual emacs commands work with  the  anticipated
          results.  In particular, you can use ^X^B, ^X^F, ^X^R, ^X^S,
          ^X^W, ^X2, ^X1, and ^X^O in  order  to  control  editing  of
          several  directories  with dired.  In general, if you read a
          directory, you edit a  directory  listing  using  the  above
          rules.   If  you  read  a file, you edit the file with emacs

          The file $HOME/.dired_init can be used to specify  initiali-
          zations  for  dired  in  the same way that $home/.emacs_init
          specifies them  for  emacs.   Emacs  macros  work  normally,
          except  that  some commands have somewhat different meanings
          when editing directories as noted above.
