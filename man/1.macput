      _M_a_c_p_u_t sends a file to a Macintosh running MacTerminal.  The File
      Transfer settings should specify the "Modem7" transfer method and a
      "MacTerminal" remote system.  This program is designed for use with
      the 1.1 Release version of MacTerminal or other terminal emulators
      that support either Mac XModem or MacBinary XModem protocols.

      To use this program, log into the unix system using MacTerminal, and
      run macput specifying the desired options and one file to be sent.  If
      MacTerminal is properly configured, it will recognize that a file is
      arriving on the serial line and put up an indicator showing how much
      of the file has been sent.  Several Control-X's may be used to force
      macput to give up if the transfer fails.

      If none of the ----rrrrdddduuuu flags are specified, _m_a_c_p_u_t sends three unix files
      to the Mac: _f_i_l_e....iiiinnnnffffoooo, _f_i_l_e....ddddaaaattttaaaa, and _f_i_l_e....rrrrssssrrrrcccc.  These specify the
      three parts of one Mac file:  the .data file becomes the data fork,
      the .rsrc file becomes the resource fork, and the .info file specifies
      the sizes of the two forks, as well as the file name, file type,
      creation date, and other information.  This is useful for returning
      files to the Mac which were stored using macget.

      The ----rrrr flag specifies _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e mode.  Either _f_i_l_e....rrrrssssrrrrcccc or _f_i_l_e will be
      sent to the Mac, along with a forged ....iiiinnnnffffoooo file and an empty ....ddddaaaattttaaaa
      file.  The file sent becomes the resource fork of the Mac file.

      The ----dddd flag specifies _d_a_t_a mode.  Either _f_i_l_e....ddddaaaattttaaaa , _f_i_l_e....tttteeeexxxxtttt or _f_i_l_e
      will be sent to the Mac, along with a forged ....iiiinnnnffffoooo file and an empty
      ....rrrrssssrrrrcccc file.  The file sent becomes the data fork of the Mac file.

      The ----xxxx flag causes a single file (in the MacBinary format) to be up
      loaded to the mac.  This file must have the extension ".BIN".

      The ----uuuu flag requests _u_n_i_x mode, which is the same as _d_a_t_a mode except
      unix newline characters are converted into carriage returns.  Human-
      readable unix text files sent to the Mac using this option will be
      compatible with applications which expect "text only" files.

      The ----bbbb flag causes macput to use the MacBinary protocol, it will also
      attempt to use CRC16 instead of checksum.

      The ----kkkk option causes macput to use 1024 byte packets instead of 128
      byte packets.  The use of this option requires MacBinary protocol.

      The remaining options serve to override the default file type, author,
      and file name to be used on the Mac.  The default type and author for
      _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e mode are "APPL" and "CCOM".  _d_a_t_a mode defaults are "TEXT",
      "????", and _u_n_i_x mode defaults are "TEXT" and "MACA".

      Any option may be preset by the environment variable MACPUT.  for
      example, by adding the following line to your .profile file:

           MACPUT=-x; export MACPUT

      will cause macput to look for a MacBinary file by default.

      The modem7 protocol will not work over flow controlled communication
      lines, some terminal concentrators, or when using rlogin.

      Doesn't set the bundle bit on resource files, to incorporate any icons
      into the Desk Top.  Use setfile to set the bundle bit.

      MacTerminal Beta versions 0.5 and 0.9 incorrectly calculate record
      checksums under certain circumstances, preventing some files from
      being successfully transferred; this bug has been fixed in the
      released version 1.1.
