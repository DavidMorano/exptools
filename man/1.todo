	  _t_o_d_o is an interactive, menu driven system to	improve	organ-
	  ization and productivity by keeping personal 'to do' lists
	  online.  _T_o_d_o	may be used interactively or from the command
	  line to produce reports.

	  A _t_o_d_o list is a collection of statements reflecting activi-
	  ties which must be accomplished by a given date.  Once an
	  activity is completed, it is archived	with the date done and
	  an optional comment.	The comment allows an explanation if a
	  task is late.	 _T_o_d_o items may	be grouped into	categories to
	  aid in organization.	Selecting the category name is up to
	  the user.  Any name with 10 (8 for MSDOS) or fewer
	  alphanumeric characters may be used.	The category GGGGeeeennnneeeerrrraaaallll
	  is provided by default.

	  ----hhhh	    Print a usage message, the current version,	a help
		    message and	exit.

	  ----VVVV	    Print the current version and exit.

	  ----dddd _d_i_r    Use	_d_i_r as the _t_o_d_o	directory.  Default is
		    $$$$TTTTOOOODDDDOOOO____DDDDIIIIRRRR, or $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE////ttttooooddddoooo if	that is	not set.  If
		    this directory does	not exist, _t_o_d_o	will attempt
		    to create it.  This	may fail if one	of the path
		    components does not	exist.	All files in the _t_o_d_o
		    directory are considered _t_o_d_o files.

	  ----DDDD _d_a_t_e   Use	_d_a_t_e as	the current date.  This	is the date at
		    which items	are considered overdue.	 The default
		    is today's date.  When printing archives [-S or
		    -P], _d_a_t_e will limit printing to those items com-
		    pleted on or after this date.

	  ++++DDDD _d_a_t_e   Only print [-p or -P] items	up to and including
		    _d_a_t_e. This is useful for printing any items	that
		    are	due in a specific time period.	In addition,
		    the	ending date may	not come before	the starting
		    date.

	  ----ssss ddddppppaaaarrrr   Set	the sort order for categories.	Default	is
		    ddddppppaaaa.... Ordering is significant.

		    dddd Use dates	to sort	with.

		    aaaa Use abstracts to sort with.

		    rrrr Set reverse sort mode.  This sort	flag acts as a
		      toggle.

	  ----qqqq	    Suppress (quiet) the help messages that appear in
		    the	menu.  This flag acts as a toggle.

	  ----nnnn	    Disable skipping multiple entries in the change
		    category menu.  By default,	you may	enter a	number
		    and	then an	up/down	motion and move	that number of
		    entries at one time.  This option works as a tog-
		    gle	only when running interactively.

	  ----bbbb	    Ignore SIGINT when running interactively.  The
		    default is to catch	the signal and kill the

	  ----AAAA	    Use	an alternate printing format for items and

	  ----aaaa	    When printing the categories, print	even the empty

	  ----HHHH	    Suppress the headings generated with the ----pppp	or ----PPPP

		    is useful in combination with the ----wwww 0000 option.
		    _t_o_d_o's output can then be piped to other commands

	  ----uuuu	    Set	the default date to unknown when adding	new

		    option.  Default is	llllssssooooeeee.... Ordering is not signifi-
		    cant.

		    llll Print late items.

		    ssss Print items that have slipped.

		    oooo Print on-time items.

		    eeee Print early items.

	  ----xxxx _l_v_l    Set	the default priority level to _l_v_l. Priority
		    levels may be between 1 and	9, inclusive.  The
		    default is 9.  When	used in	the non-interactive
		    mode, this option will suppress any	items whose
		    priority level is greater than _l_v_l.

	  ----wwww _w_i_d_t_h  Only allow _w_i_d_t_h characters	for each line.	If an
		    abstract is	too long, it is	wrapped	and indented
		    to the next	line.  (There is no word parsing done,
		    it is strictly character oriented.)	 Lines are not
		    allowed to be limited to less than 50 characters
		    except in the case where it	is less	than or	equal
		    to 0.  In this case, no width restriction is
		    applied.  If a shorter line	is attempted, the
		    width restriction will be turned off.  When	print-
		    ing	to standard output, the	default	is defined by
		    the	environment variable CCCCOOOOLLLLUUUUMMMMNNNNSSSS.... If this is not
		    set, 80 columns are	used.  Interactively, the
		    default is the width of the	window.

	  _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y  Use	only _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y when printing.  When a _c_a_t_e_g_o_r_y
		    is specified for interactive mode, that category
		    is the one displayed on entering the command.  Any
		    additional ones are	listed in the change category
		    menu in the	order the were entered.	 Any not
		    specified are sorted below these.

	  Several of the above options may be set with the environment
	  variable TTTTOOOODDDDOOOO____OOOOPPPPTTTTSSSS.... This allows some tailoring of the	com-
	  mand without having to specify the arguments on every	invo-
	  cation.  Command line	arguments will override	the ones set
	  in the environment.  The allowable arguments are: ----ssss_d_p_a_r, ----
	  qqqq,,,, ----nnnn,,,, ----bbbb,,,, ----AAAA,,,, ----aaaa,,,, ----HHHH,,,, ----uuuu,,,, ----oooo,,,, ----OOOO,,,, ----XXXX_l_s_o, ----xxxx_l_v_l and ----wwww_w_i_d_t_h.
	  The ----ssss,,,, ----XXXX,,,, ----xxxx and ----wwww	options	require	the use	of a colon (::::)

	  after	the argument if	other options are to follow it.	 This
	  is used to separate the option's argument from other
	  options.  For	example, set TODO_OPTS="w79:asr" to use	a
	  width	of 79 when printing, to	list all the categories	when
	  printing, and	to sort	items in reverse order for each
	  category.  These options are subject to any restrictions
	  listed above.	 The command line will over-ride any of	these
	  options that are not listed as toggles.

	  When invoked,	_t_o_d_o displays the menu on the upper half of
	  the screen, and the GGGGeeeennnneeeerrrraaaallll to do list (or the one specified
	  on the command line) on the lower half of the	screen.	 _T_o_d_o
	  commands are entered as noted	below.	Information such as
	  item numbers and due dates are prompted for as they are
	  required.  The following is a	compressed representation of a
	  typical _t_o_d_o list as displayed on the	screen:

       5  Unknown     9	 Start writing novel

	  Certain parts	of the menu area are highlighted.  If the menu
	  description is highlighted, then it is the current command.
	  If the letter	before it is highlighted, then when that key
	  is hit, that command will automatically be executed and made
	  current.  Otherwise, the command simply becomes highlighted
	  as current.

	  If a category	has too	many lines for the lower part of the
	  screen, the abstracts	are paged, with	an option to stop pag-
	  ing.	Each _t_o_d_o item is displayed with an item number, due
	  date,	and abstract.  The due date is highlighted if it is
	  overdue (older than the current date)	or flashes if it is
	  due on the current date.  Items are sorted and displayed in
	  chronological-priority-lexical order.

	  When the ----pppp or ----PPPP options are	used, _t_o_d_o will	use the	termi-
	  nal attributes to hightlight or flash	an item	based on its
	  due date as noted above.  If the output is redirected, the
	  highlighting of a date changes to "*01/01/1991*" and flash-
	  ing changes to "!01/01/1991!".

	  Whenever a string of data (date, priority or abstract) is
	  requested, it	is possible to edit that string.  Editing
	  style	is either emacs	or vi based.  The style	to use is
	  defined by the environment variable LLLLNNNNEEEEDDDDIIIITTTT.... If it is set to
	  _v_i, _e_x or _v_e_d_i_t vi-mode is used.  If it is set to _g_m_a_c_s,
	  gmacs-mode is	used.  If it is	set to anything	else, emacs-
	  mode is used.	 If LLLLNNNNEEEEDDDDIIIITTTT is not set, then EEEEDDDDIIIITTTTOOOORRRR is used.
	  If that is not set, emacs-mode is used.  Gmacs-mode is the
	  same as emacs	except in how they handle control-T.
	  Currently, any practical emacs/vi ksh	command	has been
	  implemented.	Commands dealing with histories, name comple-
	  tion,	etc have no meaning.

	  A year may not be greater than 9999 (for formatting pur-
	  poses).  In addition,	there is a sanity check	built in.  If
	  the year specified is	more than 5 years in the future, _t_o_d_o
	  will either prompt you if this is okay or print a warning
	  message.  The	message	type depends on	whether	you are
	  interacting with the program or not.

	  _t_o_d_o only updates its	files when requested or	when it	exits.
	  Causing the program to terminate abnormally (causing a
	  SIGQUIT, logging off the system, etc)	will _n_o_t update	the
	  files.  This can be of use if	you delete an item or category
	  you did not want to.

	  _t_o_d_o has a minimum requirement for the size of the window it
	  is running in.  It requires at least 70 columns and 13 rows.

	  The patterns generated in the	category change	menu are not
	  regular expressions.	They are simple	matches.

	  When printing	archives, the comment line begins with a '+'.
	  This line may	be unexpectly truncated	at the bottom of a
	  page when it is listed in the	interactive mode.

	  When running _t_o_d_o interactively (in curses), the terminal's
	  hardware tabstops should be set to 8.	 Otherwise the output
	  may get garbled.  Curses attempts to optimize	cursor motion
	  and will use tabs to position	that it	assumes	are set	at 8.

	  This is based	on a September 1986 version by M. J. Desch
	  [AT&T	Network	Systems].  This	version	is _n_o_t compatible with
	  that.	 The data file organization is different.

	  The data in the todo files is	organized in sets.  The	first
	  line defines how many	lines are in the data set.  Comments
	  are allowed between sets of data, however they may not be
	  nested within	a set.

	  There	are a few minor	differences in the MSDOS version.

	  ----  The HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE environment variable does	not need to be set.
	     If	not set, cccc::::\\\\ is	used.

	  ----  The !!!! shell escape	command	is not available.

	  ----  Category names are	limited	to 8 characters.

	  ----  The directory name	used with the ----dddd option	may be an
	     environment variable.  _t_o_d_o will expand $$$$nnnnaaaammmmeeee....
