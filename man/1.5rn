	  _5_r_n is a replacement for the readnews(1) program that	was
	  written to be	as efficient as	possible, particularly in
	  human	interaction.  _5_r_n attempts to minimize the amount of
	  "dead" time spent reading news - it tries to get things done
	  while	the user is reading or deciding	whether	to read, and
	  attempts to get useful information onto the screen as	soon
	  as possible, highlighting spots that the eye makes frequent
	  reference to,	like subjects and previously read lines.
	  Whether or not it's faster, it SEEMS faster.

	  If no	newsgroups are specified, all the newsgroups which
	  have unread news are displayed, and then the user is asked
	  for each one whether he wants	to read	it, in the order in
	  which	the newsgroups occur in	the ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c file.  With a
	  list of newsgroups, _5_r_n will start up	in "add" mode, using
	  the list as a	set of patterns	to add new newsgroups and
	  restrict which newsgroups are	displayed.  See	the discussion
	  of the 'a' command on	the newsgroup selection	level.

	  _5_r_n operates on three	levels:	the newsgroup selection	level,
	  the article selection	level, and the paging level.  Each
	  level	has its	own set	of commands, and its own help menu.
	  At the paging	level (the bottom level), _5_r_n behaves much
	  like the _m_o_r_e(1) program.  At	the article selection level,
	  you may specify which	article	you want next, or read them in
	  the default order, which is either in	order of arrival on
	  your system, or by subject threads.  At the newsgroup
	  selection level (the top level), you may specify which
	  newsgroup you	want next, or read them	in the default order,
	  which	is the order that the newsgroups occur in your
	  ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c file.  (You will therefore want to rearrange	your
	  ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c file	to put the most	interesting newsgroups first.
	  This can be done with	the 'm'	command	on the Newsgroup
	  Selection level.  WARNING: invoking readnews/vnews (the old
	  user interface) in any way (including	as a news checker in
	  your login sequence!)	will cause your	._5_n_e_w_s_r_c to be
	  disarranged again.)

	  On any level,	at ANY prompt, an 'h' may be typed for a list
	  of available commands.  This is probably the most important
	  command to remember, so don't	you forget it.	Typing space
	  to any question means	to do the normal thing.	 You will know
	  what that is because every prompt has	a list of several
	  plausible commands enclosed in square	brackets.  The first
	  command in the list is the one which will be done if you

	  type a space.	 (All input is done in cbreak mode, so
	  carriage returns should not be typed to terminate anything
	  except certain multi-character commands.  Those commands
	  will be obvious in the discussion below because they take an
	  argument.)

	  Upon startup,	_5_r_n will do several things:

	  1.  It will look for your ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c file, which is your list
	      of subscribed-to newsgroups.  If _5_r_n doesn't find	a
	      ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c,	it will	create one.  If	it does	find one, it
	      will back	it up under the	name ".5oldnewsrc".

	  2.  It will input your ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c file,	listing	out the	first
	      several newsgroups with unread news.

	  3.  It will perform certain consistency checks on your
	      ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c.	 If your ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c is out of date in any	of
	      several ways, _5_r_n	will warn you and patch	it up for you,
	      but you may have to wait a little	longer for it to start
	      up.

	  4.  _5_r_n will next check to see if any	new newsgroups have
	      been created, and	give you the opportunity to add	them
	      to your ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c.

	  5.  _5_r_n goes into the	top prompt level - the newsgroup
	      selection	level.

	  NNNNeeeewwwwssssggggrrrroooouuuupppp SSSSeeeelllleeeeccccttttiiiioooonnnn LLLLeeeevvvveeeellll

	  In this section the words "next" and "previous" refer	to the
	  ordering of the newsgroups in	your ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c file.  On	the
	  newsgroup selection level, the prompt	looks like this:

	  ******** 17 unread articles in talk.blurfl - read now? [ynq]

	  and the following commands may be given at this level:

	  y,SP	  Do this newsgroup now.

	  .command
		  Do this newsgroup now, but execute _c_o_m_m_a_n_d before
		  displaying anything.	The command will be
		  interpreted as if given on the article selection
		  level.

	  =	  Do this newsgroup now, but list subjects before
		  displaying articles.

	  /pattern
		  Scan forward for a newsgroup matching	_p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
		  Patterns do globbing like filenames, i.e., use ? to
		  match	a single character, * to match any sequence of
		  characters, and [] to	specify	a list of characters
		  to match.  ("all" may	be used	as a synonym for "*".)
		  Unlike normal	filename globbing, newsgroup searching
		  is not anchored to the front and back	of the
		  filename, i.e. "/ski"	will find rec.skiing.  You may
		  use ^	or $ to	anchor the front or back of the
		  search: "/^test$" will find newsgroup	test and
		  nothing else If you want to include newsgroups with
		  0 unread articles, append /r.	 If the	newsgroup is
		  not found between the	current	newsgroup and the last
		  newsgroup, the search	will wrap around to the
		  beginning.

	  ?pattern
		  Same as /, but search	backwards.

	  u	  Unsubscribe from current newsgroup.

	  l string
		  List newsgroups not subscribed to which contain the
		  string specified.

	  L	  Lists	the current state of the ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c, along with

		  (A bogus newsgroup is	one that is not	in the list of

		  NNTP.)

	  m name  Move the named newsgroup somewhere else in the

		  specify where	you want the newsgroup - type h	for
		  help when it asks where you want to put it.

	  c	  Catch	up - mark all unread articles in this
		  newsgroup as read.

	  o pattern
		  Only display those newsgroups	whose name matches
		  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Patterns are the same as for the '/'
		  command.  Multiple patterns may be separated by
		  spaces, just as on the command line.	The
		  restriction will remain in effect either until there
		  are no articles left in the restricted set of
		  newsgroups, or another restriction command is	given.
		  Since	_p_a_t_t_e_r_n	is optional, 'o' by itself will	remove
		  the restriction.

	  a pattern
		  Add new newsgroups matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.	Newsgroups
		  which	are already in your ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c file, whether
		  subscribed to	or not,	will not be listed.  If	any
		  new newsgroups are found, you	will be	asked for each
		  one whether you would	like to	add it.	 After any new
		  newsgroups have been added, the 'a' command also
		  restricts the	current	set of newsgroups just like
		  the 'o' command does.

	  &	  Print	out the	current	status of command line
		  switches and any newsgroup restrictions.

	  &switch {switch}
		  Set additional command line switches.

	  !command
		  Escape to a subshell.	 One exclamation mark (!)
		  leaves you in	your own news directory.  A double
		  exclamation mark (!!)	leaves you in the spool
		  directory for	news, which on most systems is
		  /usr/spool/news that don't use NNTP.	The
		  environment variable SHELL will be used if defined.
		  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is	null, an interactive shell is started.

	  q	  Quit.

	  x	  Quit,	restoring .5newsrc to its state	at startup of
		  _5_r_n.	The .5newsrc you would have had	if you had
		  exited with 'q' will be called .newnewsrc, in	case
		  you didn't really want to type 'x'.

	  ^K	  Edit the global KILL file.  This is a	file which
		  contains /pattern/j commands (one per	line) to be
		  applied to every newsgroup as	it is started up, that
		  is, when it is selected on the newsgroup selection
		  level.  The purpose of a KILL	file is	to mark
		  articles as read on the basis	of some	set of
		  patterns.  This saves	considerable wear and tear on
		  your 'n' key.	 There is also a local KILL file for
		  each newsgroup.  Because of the overhead involved in
		  searching for	articles to kill, it is	better if
		  possible to use a local KILL file.  Local KILL files
		  are edited with a '^K' on the	article	selection
		  level.  There	are also automatic ways	of adding
		  search commands to the local KILL file - see the 'K'
		  command and the K search modifier on the article
		  selection level.

		  If either of the environment variables VISUAL	or
		  EDITOR is set, the specified editor will be invoked;
		  otherwise a default editor (normally vi(1)) is
		  invoked on the KILL file.

	  On the article selection level, _5_r_n selects (by default)
	  unread articles in numerical order (the order	in which

	  search (^N), the default order is modified to	be numerical
	  order	within each subject thread.  You may switch back and
	  forth	between	numerical order	and subject thread order at
	  will.	 The ----SSSS	switch can be used to make subject search mode
	  the default.

	  On the article selection level you are _n_o_t asked whether you
	  want to read an article before the article is	displayed;
	  rather, _5_r_n simply displays the first	page (or portion of a

	  to continue.	The normal article selection prompt comes at
	  the END of the article (though article selection commands
	  can be given from within the middle of the article (the
	  pager	level) also).  The prompt at the end of	an article
	  looks	like this:

	  End of article 248 (of 257) -	what next? [npq]

	  The following	are the	options	at this	point:

	  n,SP	  Scan forward for next	unread article.	 (Note:	the
		  'n' (next) command when typed	at the end of an
		  article does not mark	the article as read, since an
		  article is automaticaly marked as read after the
		  last line of it is printed.  It is therefore
		  possible to type a sequence such as 'mn' and leave
		  the article marked as	unread.	 The fact that an
		  article is marked as read by typing 'n', 'N',	'^N',
		  's', or 'S' within the MIDDLE	of the article is in
		  fact a special case.)

	  N	  Go to	the next article.

	  ^N	  Scan forward for the next article with the same

	  number  Go to	the numbered article.

	  range{,range}	command{:command}
		  Apply	a set of commands to a set of articles.	 A
		  range	consists of either <article number> or
		  <article number>-<article number>.  A	dot '.'
		  represents the current article, and a	dollar sign
		  '$' represents the last article.

		  Applicable commands include 'm' (mark	as unread),
		  'M' (delayed mark as unread),	'j' (mark as read), "s
		  dest"	(save to a destination), "!command" (shell
		  escape), "=" (print the subject) and "C" (cancel).

	  j	  Junk the current article - mark it as	read.  If this
		  command is used from within an article, you are left
		  at the end of	the article, unlike 'n', which looks
		  for the next article.

	  m	  Mark the current article as still unread.  (If you
		  are in subject search	mode you probably want to use
		  M instead of m.  Otherwise the current article may
		  be selected as the beginning of the next subject
		  thread.)

	  M	  Mark the current article as still unread, but	not
		  until	the newsgroup is exited.  Until	then, the
		  current article will be marked as read.  This	is
		  useful for returning to an article in	another
		  session, or in another newsgroup.

	  /pattern
		  Scan forward for article containing _p_a_t_t_e_r_n in the
		  subject.  See	the section on Regular Expressions.
		  Together with	the escape substitution	facility
		  described later, it becomes easy to search for
		  various attributes of	the current article, such as
		  subject, article ID, author name, etc.  The previous
		  pattern can be recalled with "<esc>/".  If _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
		  is omitted, the previous pattern is assumed.

	  /pattern/a
		  Scan forward for article containing _p_a_t_t_e_r_n anywhere
		  in article.

	  /pattern/r
		  Scan read articles also.

	  /pattern/c
		  Make search case sensitive.  Ordinarily upper	and
		  lower	case are considered the	same.

	  /pattern/modifiers:command{:command}
		  Apply	the commands listed to articles	matching the
		  search command (possibly with	h, a, or r modifiers).
		  Applicable commands include 'm' (mark	as unread),
		  'M' (delayed mark as unread),	'j' (mark as read), "s
		  dest"	(save to a destination), "!command" (shell
		  escape), "=" (print the subject) and "C" (cancel).
		  If the first command is 'm' or 'M', modifier r is

		  the commands)	to cause the entire command (sans K)
		  to be	saved to the local KILL	file, where it will be
		  applied to every article that	shows up in the
		  newsgroup.

		  For example, to save all articles in a given
		  newsgroup to the line	printer	and mark them read,
		  use "/^/|lpr:j".  If you type	"/^/K|lpr:j", this
		  will happen every time you enter the newsgroup.

		  Scan backward	for article containing _p_a_t_t_e_r_n in the
		  subject.  May	be modified as the forward search is:
		  ?pattern?modifiers[:commands].  It is	likely that
		  you will want	an r modifier when scanning backward.

	  k	  Mark as read all articles with the same subject as
		  the current article.	(Note: there is	no single
		  character command to temporarily mark	as read	(M
		  command) articles matching the current subject.
		  That can be done with	"/<esc>s/M", however.)

	  K	  Do the same as the k command,	but also add a line to
		  the local KILL file for this newsgroup to kill this
		  subject every	time the newsgroup is started up.  For
		  a discussion of KILL files, see the '^K' command
		  below.  See also the K modifier on searches above.

	  ^K	  Edit the local KILL file for this newsgroup.	Each
		  line of the KILL file	should be a command of the
		  form /pattern/j.  (With the exception	that _5_r_n will
		  insert a line	at the beginning of the	form "THRU
		  <number>", which tells _5_r_n the maximum article
		  number that the KILL file has	been applied to.  You
		  may delete the THRU line to force a rescan of
		  current articles.)  You may also have	reason to use
		  the m, h, or a modifiers.  Be	careful	with the M
		  modifier in a	kill file - there are more efficient
		  ways to never	read an	article.  You might have
		  reason to use	it if a	particular series of articles
		  is posted to multiple	newsgroups.  In	this case, M
		  would	force you to view the article in a different
		  newsgroup.

		  To see only newgroup articles	in the control
		  newsgroup, for instance, you might put

		  /^/j
		  /newgroup/m

		  which	kills all subjects not containing "newgroup".
		  You can add lines automatically via the K command
		  and K	search modifiers, but editing is the only way
		  to remove lines.  If either of the environment
		  variables VISUAL or EDITOR is	set, the specified
		  editor will be invoked; otherwise a default editor
		  (normally vi)	is invoked on the KILL file.

		  The KILL file	may also contain switch	setting	lines
		  beginning with '&'.  Additionally, any line
		  beginning with 'X' is	executed on exit from the
		  newsgroup rather than	on entrance.  This can be used
		  to set switches back to a default value.

	  r	  Reply	through	net mail.  The environment variables
		  MAILPOSTER and MAILHEADER may	be used	to modify the
		  mailing behavior of _5_r_n (see environment section).
		  If on	a nonexistent article such as the "End of
		  newsgroup" pseudo-article (which you can get to with

		  particular.

	  R	  Reply, including the current article in the header
		  file generated.  (See	'F' command below).  The
		  YOUSAID environment variable controls	the format of
		  the attribution line.

	  f	  Submit a followup article.  If on a nonexistent
		  article such as the "End of newsgroup" pseudo-

		  provide an attribution line in front of the quoted
		  article, generated from the From: line of the
		  article.  Unfortunately, the From: line doesn't
		  always contain the right name; you should double
		  check	it against the signature and change it if
		  necessary, or	you may	have to	apologize for quoting
		  the wrong person.  The environment variables
		  NEWSPOSTER, NEWSHEADER and ATTRIBUTION may be	used
		  to modify the	posting	behavior of _5_r_n	(see
		  environment section).

	  C	  Cancel the current article, but only if you are the
		  contributor or superuser.

	  c	  Catch	up in this newsgroup; i.e., mark all articles

	  u	  Unsubscribe to this newsgroup.

	  s destination
		  Save to a filename or	pipe using sh.	If the first
		  character of the destination is a vertical bar, the
		  rest of the command is considered a shell command to
		  which	the article is passed through standard input.
		  The command is subject to filename expansion.	 (See
		  also the environment variable	PIPESAVER.)  If	the
		  destination does not begin with a vertical bar, the
		  rest of the command is assumed to be a filename of
		  some sort.  An initial tilde '~' will	be translated
		  to the name of the home directory, and an initial
		  environment variable substitution is also allowed.
		  If only a directory name is specified, the
		  environment variable SAVENAME	is used	to generate
		  the actual name.  If only a filename is specified
		  (i.e.	no directory), the environment variable
		  SAVEDIR will be used to generate the actual
		  directory.  If nothing is specified, then obviously
		  both variables will be used.	Since the current
		  directory for	rn while doing a save command is your
		  private news directory, typing "s ./filename"	will
		  force	the file to your news directory.  Save
		  commands are also run	through	% interpretation, so
		  that you can enter "s	%O/filename" to	save to	the
		  directory you	were in	when you ran _5_r_n, and "s %t"
		  to save to a filename	consisting of the Internet
		  address of the sender.

		  After	generating the full pathname of	the file to
		  save to, _5_r_n determines if the file exists already,
		  and if so, appends to	it.  _5_r_n will attempt to
		  determine if an existing file	is a mailbox or	a
		  normal file, and save	the article in the same
		  format.  If the output file does not yet exist, _5_r_n
		  will by default ask you which	format you want, or
		  you can make it skip the question with either	the ----MMMM
		  or ----NNNN	switch.	 If the	article	is to be saved in
		  mailbox format, the command to do so is generated
		  from the environment variable	MBOXSAVER.  Otherwise,
		  NORMSAVER is used.

	  S destination
		  Save to a filename or	pipe using a preferred shell,
		  such as csh.	Which shell is used depends first on
		  what you have	the environment	variable SHELL set to,
		  and in the absence of	that, on what your news
		  administrator	set for	the preferred shell when he or
		  she installed	_5_r_n.

	  | command

	  w destination
		  The same as "s destination", but saves without the

	  &switch {switch}
		  Set additional command line switches.

	  &&	  Print	out current macro definitions.

	  &&keys commands
		  Define an additional macro.

	  !command
		  Escape to a subshell.	 One exclamation mark (!)
		  leaves you in	your own news directory.  A double
		  exclamation mark (!!)	leaves you in the spool
		  directory of the current newsgroup.  The environment
		  variable SHELL will be used if defined.  If _c_o_m_m_a_n_d
		  is null, an interactive shell	is started.

	  At the pager level (within an	article), the prompt looks

	  x	  Display next page and	decrypt	as a rot13 message.

	  d,^D	  Display half a page more.

	  CR	  Display one more line.

		  of the last line on the screen.  It searches for the
		  first	line that doesn't begin	with the same

	  !command
		  Escape to a subshell.

	  The following	commands skip the rest of the current article,
	  then behave just as if typed to the "What next?" prompt at
	  the end of the article.  See the documentation at the
	  article selection level for these commands.

	      #	$ & / =	? c C f	F k K ^K m M r R ^R u v	Y ^
	      number
	      range{,range} command{:command}

	  The following	commands also skip to the end of the article,
	  but have the additional effect of marking the	current
	  article as read:

	      n	N ^N s S | w W


	  MMMMiiiisssscccceeeellllllllaaaannnneeeeoooouuuussss	ffffaaaaccccttttssss aaaabbbboooouuuutttt ccccoooommmmmmmmaaaannnnddddssss

	  An 'n' typed at either the "Last newsgroup" prompt or	a
	  "Last	article" prompt	will cycle back	to the top of the
	  newsgroup or article list, whereas a 'q' will	quit the
	  level.  (Note	that 'n' does not mean "no", but rather
	  "next".)  A space will of course do whatever is shown	as the
	  default, which will vary depending on	whether	rn thinks you
	  have more articles or	newsgroups to read.

	  The 'b' (backup page)	command	may be repeated	until the
	  beginning of the article is reached.	If _5_r_n is suspended
	  (via a ^Z), then when	the job	is resumed, a refresh (^L)
	  will automatically be	done (Berkeley-type systems only).  If
	  you type a command such as '!' or 's'	which takes you	from
	  the middle of	the article to the end,	you can	always get
	  back into the	middle by typing '^L'.

	  In multi-character commands such as '!', 's',	'/', etc, you
	  can interpolate various run-time values by typing escape and
	  a character.	To find	out what you can interpolate, type
	  escape and 'h', or check out the single character %
	  substitutions	for environment	variables in the

	  _5_r_n has a nice set of	options	to allow you to	tailor the
	  interaction to your liking.  (You might like to know that
	  the author swears by "-e -m -S -/".)	These options may be
	  set on the command line, via the RNINIT environment
	  variable, via	a file pointed to by the RNINIT	variable, or
	  from within rn via the & command.  Options may generally be
	  unset	by typing "+switch".  Options include:

	  ----cccc   checks for news without reading news.  If a list	of
	       newsgroups is given on the command line,	only those
	       newsgroups will be checked; otherwise all subscribed-to
	       newsgroups are checked.	Whenever the ----cccc	switch is
	       specified, a non-zero exit status from _5_r_n means	that
	       there is	unread news in one of the checked newsgroups.
	       The ----cccc switch does not disable the printing of
	       newsgroups with unread news; this is controlled by the
	       ----ssss switch.  (The	----cccc switch is not meaningful when given
	       via the & command.)

	       tells _5_r_n how often to checkpoint the ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c, in
	       articles	read.  Actually, this number says when to
	       start thinking about doing a checkpoint if the
	       situation is right.  If a reasonable checkpointing
	       situation doesn't arise within 10 more articles,	the
	       ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c	is checkpointed	willy-nilly.

	       sets the	default	save directory to something other than
	       ~/News.	The directory name will	be globbed (via	csh)
	       if necessary (and if possible).	Articles saved by _5_r_n
	       may be placed in	the save directory or in a
	       subdirectory thereof depending on the command that you
	       give and	the state of the environment variables SAVEDIR
	       and SAVENAME.  Any KILL files (see the K	command	in the
	       Article Selection section) also reside in this
	       directory and its subdirectories, by default.  In
	       addition, shell escapes leave you in this directory.

	  ----eeee   causes each page	within an article to be	started	at the
	       top of the screen, not just the first page.  (It	is
	       similar to the ----cccc switch	of _m_o_r_e(1).)  You never	have
	       to read scrolling text with this	switch.	 This is
	       helpful especially at certain baud rates	because	you
	       can start reading the top of the	next page without
	       waiting for the whole page to be	printed.  It works
	       nicely in conjuction with the ----mmmm	switch,	especially if
	       you use half-intensity for your highlight mode.	See
	       also the	----LLLL switch.

	       sets the	environment variable <name> to the value
	       specified.  Within _5_r_n, "&-ESAVENAME=%t"	is similar to
	       "setenv SAVENAME	'%t'" in _c_s_h, or "SAVENAME='%t';
	       export SAVENAME"	in _s_h.	Any environment	variables set

	       sets the	prefix string for the 'F' followup command to
	       use in prefixing	each line of the quoted	article.  For
	       example,	"-F<tab>" inserts a tab	on the front of	each
	       line (which will	cause long lines to wrap around,
	       unfortunately), "-F>>>>"	inserts	">>>>" on every	line,
	       and "-F"	by itself causes nothing to be inserted, in
	       case you	want to	reformat the text, for instance.  The
	       initial default prefix is ">".

	  ----gggg<<<<lllliiiinnnneeee>>>>
	       tells _5_r_n which line of the screen you want searched-
	       for strings to show up on when you search with the 'g'
	       command within an article.  The lines are numbered
	       starting	with 1.	 The initial default is	"-g1", meaning
	       the first line of the screen.  Setting the line to less
	       than 1 or more than the number of lines on the screen
	       will set	it to the last line of the screen.

	       hides (disables the printing of)	all header lines
	       beginning with _s_t_r_i_n_g. For instance, -hexp will disable
	       the printing of the "Expires:" line.  Case is
	       insignificant.  If <string> is null, all	header lines
	       except Subject are hidden, and you may then use ++++hhhh to
	       select those lines you want to see.  You	may wish to

	       the following actions are caused	by the flag for	the
	       particular line:	the Newsgroups line will only print
	       when there are multiple newsgroups, the Subject line
	       will be underlined, and the Expires line	will always be
	       suppressed if there is nothing on it.  In fact, all of
	       these actions are the default, and you must use ++++HHHH to
	       undo them.

	       specifies how long (in lines) to	consider the initial
	       page of an article - normally this is determined
	       automatically depending on baud rate.  (Note that an
	       entire article header will always be printed regardless
	       of the specified	initial	page length.  If you are
	       working at low baud rate	and wish to reduce the size of
	       the headers, you	may hide certain header	lines with the
	       hhhh switch.)

	  ----llll   disables	the clearing of	the screen at the beginning of
	       each article, in	case you have a	bizarre	terminal.

	  ----LLLL   tells _5_r_n to leave information on the screen as long as
	       possible	by not blanking	the screen between pages, and
	       by using	clear to end-of-line.  (The _m_o_r_e(1) program
	       does this.)  This feature works only if you have	the
	       requisite termcap capabilities.	The switch has no
	       effect unless the ----eeee switch is set.

	  ----mmmm====<<<<mmmmooooddddeeee>>>>
	       enables the marking of the last line of the previous
	       page printed, to	help the user see where	to continue
	       reading.	 This is most helpful when less	than a full
	       page is going to	be displayed.  It may also be used in
	       conjunction with	the ----eeee switch, in which	case the page
	       is erased, and the first	line (which is the last	line
	       of the previous page) is	highlighted.  If ----mmmm====ssss is
	       specified, the standout mode will be used, but if ----mmmm====uuuu
	       is specified, underlining will be used.	If neither ====ssss
	       or ====uuuu is	specified, standout is the default.  Use ++++mmmm to
	       disable highlighting.

	  ----MMMM   forces mailbox format in	creating new save files.
	       Ordinarily you are asked	which format you want.

	  ----NNNN   forces normal (non-mailbox) format in creating new save
	       files.  Ordinarily you are asked	which format you want.

	  ----rrrr   causes _5_r_n to restart in	the last newsgroup read	during
	       a previous session with _5_r_n. It is equivalent to
	       starting	up normally and	then getting to	the newsgroup
	       with a g	command.

	  ----ssss   with no argument	suppresses the initial listing of
	       newsgroups with unread news, whether ----cccc is specified or
	       not.  Thus ----cccc and ----ssss can	be used	together to test
	       "silently" the status of	news from within your ._l_o_g_i_n
	       file.  If ----ssss is followed	by a number, the initial
	       listing is suppressed after that	many lines have	been
	       listed.	Presuming that you have	your ._5_n_e_w_s_r_c sorted
	       into order of interest, ----ssss5555 will	tell you the 5 most
	       interesting newsgroups that have	unread news.  This is
	       also a nice feature to use in your ._l_o_g_i_n file, since
	       it not only tells you whether there is unread news, but
	       also how	important the unread news is, without having
	       to wade through the entire list of unread newsgroups.
	       If no ----ssss	switch is given	----ssss5555 is assumed,	so just
	       putting "rn -c" into your .login	file is	fine.

	       causes _5_r_n to enter subject search mode (^N)
	       automatically whenever a	newsgroup is started up	with
	       <number>	unread articles	or more.  Additionally,	it
	       causes any 'n' typed while in subject search mode to be
	       interpreted as '^N' instead.  (To get back out of
	       subject search mode, the	best command is	probably '^'.)
	       If <number> is omitted, 3 is assumed.

	  ----tttt   puts _5_r_n	into terse mode.  This is more cryptic but
	       useful for low baud rates.  (Note that your system
	       administrator may have compiled _5_r_n with	either verbose
	       or terse	messages only to save memory.)	You may	wish
	       to use the baud-rate switch modifier below to enable
	       terse mode only at lower	baud rates.

	  ----TTTT   allows you to type ahead	of rn.	Ordinarily rn will eat
	       typeahead to prevent your autorepeating space bar from
	       doing a very frustrating	thing when you accidentally
	       hold it down.  If you don't have	a repeating space bar,
	       or you are working at low baud rate, you	can set	this
	       switch to prevent this behavior.	 You may wish to use
	       the baud-rate switch modifier below to disable
	       typeahead only at lower baud rates.

	  ----vvvv   sets verification mode for commands.  When set, the
	       command being executed is displayed to give some
	       feedback	that the key has actually been typed.  Useful
	       when the	system is heavily loaded and you give a
	       command that takes a while to start up.

	  ----////   sets SAVEDIR to "%p/%c" and SAVENAME to "%a", which
	       means that by default articles are saved	in a
	       subdirectory of your private news directory
	       corresponding to	the name of the	the current newsgroup,
	       with the	filename being the article number.  ++++//// sets

	       SAVEDIR to "%p" and SAVENAME to "%^C", which by default
	       saves articles directly to your private news directory,
	       with the	filename being the name	of the current
	       newsgroup, first	letter capitalized.  (Either ++++////	or ----////
	       may be default on your system, depending	on the
	       feelings	of your	news administrator when	he, she	or it
	       installed _5_r_n.)	You may, of course, explicitly set
	       SAVEDIR and SAVENAME to other values - see discussion
	       in the environment section.

	  Any switch may be selectively	applied	according to the
	  current baud-rate.  Simply prefix the	switch with +speed to
	  apply	the switch at that speed or greater, and -speed	to
	  apply	the switch at that speed or less.  Examples:
	  -1200-hposted	suppresses the Posted line at 1200 baud	or
	  less;	+9600-m	enables	marking	at 9600	baud or	more.  You can
	  apply	the modifier recursively to itself also: +300-1200-t
	  sets terse mode from 300 to 1200 baud.

	  Similarly, switches may be selected based on terminal	type:

	       -=vt100+T      set +T on	vt100
	       -=tvi920-ETERM=mytvi	get a special termcap entry
	       -=tvi920-ERNMACRO=%./.rnmac.tvi
			      set up special keymappings
	       +=paper-v      set verify mode if not hardcopy

	  Some switch arguments, such as environment variable values,
	  may require spaces in	them.  Such spaces should be quoted
	  via ", ', or \ in the	conventional fashion, even when	passed
	  via RNINIT or	the & command.

	  The patterns used in article searching are regular
	  expressions such as those used by _e_d(1).  In addition, \w
	  matches an alphanumeric character and	\W a nonalphanumeric.
	  Word boundaries may be matched by \b,	and non-boundaries by
	  \B.  The bracketing construct	\( ... \) may also be used,
	  and \digit matches the digit'th substring, where digit can
	  range	from 1 to 9.  \0 matches whatever the last bracket
	  match	matched.  Up to	10 alternatives	may given in a
	  pattern, separated by	\|, with the caveat that
	  \( ... \| ...	\) is illegal.

	  Many of the strings that _5_r_n handles are subject to
	  interpretations of several types.  Under filename expansion,
	  an initial "~/" is translated	to the name of your home
	  directory, and "~name" is translated to the login directory
	  for the user specified.  Filename expansion will also	expand

	  an initial environment variable, and also does the
	  backslash, uparrow and percent expansion mentioned below.

	  All interpreted strings go through backslash,	uparrow	and
	  percent interpretation.  The backslash escapes are the
	  normal ones (such as \n, \t, \nnn, etc.).  The uparrow
	  escapes indicate control codes in the	normal fashion.
	  Backslashes or uparrows to be	passed through should be
	  escaped with backslash.  The special percent escapes are
	  similar to printf percent escapes.  These cause the
	  substitution of various run-time values into the string.
	  The following	are currently recognized:

	  %a	  Current article number.

	  %A	  Full name of current article (%P/%c/%a).  (On	a
		  Eunice system	with the LINKART option, %P/%c/%a
		  returns the name of the article in the current
		  newsgroup, while %A returns the real name of the
		  article, which may be	different if the current
		  article was posted to	multiple newsgroups.)

	  %b	  Destination of last save command, often a mailbox.

	  %B	  The byte offset to the beginning of the part of the
		  article to be	saved, set by the save command.	 The
		  's' and 'S' commands set it to 0, and	the 'w'	and
		  'W' commands set it to the byte offset of the	body
		  of the article.

	  %c	  Current newsgroup, directory form.

	  %C	  Current newsgroup, dot form.

	  %d	  Full name of newsgroup directory (%P/%c).

	  %D	  "Distribution:" line from the	current	article.

	  %f	  "From:" line from the	current	article, or the
		  "Reply-To:" line if there is one.  This differs from
		  %t in	that comments (such as the full	name) are not
		  stripped out with %f.

	  %F	  "Newsgroups:"	line for a new article,	constructed
		  from "Newsgroups:" and "Followup-To:"	lines of
		  current article.

	  %h	  Name of the header file to pass to the mail or news
		  poster, containing all the information that the
		  poster program needs in the form of a	message
		  header.  It may also contain a copy of the current
		  article.  The	format of the header file is

	  %l	  The news administrator's login name, if any.

	  %L	  Login	name (yours).

	  %m	  The current mode of rn, for use in conditional
		  macros.

		       i    Initializing.

		       R    Resubscribe	to this	newsgroup?

		  Note that yes/no questions are all upper-case	modes.
		  If, for example, you wanted to disallow defaults on
		  all yes/no questions,	you could define the following
		  macro:

		  \040 %(%m=[A-Z]?h: )

	  %M	  The number of	articles marked	to return via the 'M'
		  command.  If the same	article	is Marked multiple
		  times, "%M" counts it	multiple times in the current
		  implementation.

	  %n	  "Newsgroups:"	line from the current article.

	  %N	  Full name (yours).

	  %o	  Organization (yours).

	  %O	  Original working directory (where you	ran rn from).

	  %p	  Your private news directory, normally	~/News.

	  %P	  Public news spool directory, normally
		  /usr/spool/news on systems that don't	use NNTP.

	  PAGESTOP
		  If defined, contains a regular expression which
		  matches article lines	to be treated as form-feeds.
		  There	are at least two things	you might want to do
		  with this.  To cause page breaks between articles in
		  a digest, you	might define it	as "^--------".	 To
		  force	a page break before a signature, you could
		  define it as "^-- $".	 (Then,	when you see "--" at
		  the bottom of	the page, you can skip the signature
		  if you so desire by typing 'n' instead of space.)
		  To do	both, you could	use "^--".  If you want	to
		  break	on more	than one pattern, you can use "|" to
		  separate the alternatives.

	  PIPESAVER (%)
		  The shell command to execute in order	to accomplish
		  a save to a pipe ("s | command" or "w	| command").
		  The command typed by the user	is substituted in as
		  %b.

		  Default: %(%B=^0$?<%A:tail +%Bc %A |)	%b

		  Explanation: if %B is	0, the command is "<%A %b",
		  otherwise the	command	is "tail +%Bc %A | %b".

	  RNINIT  Default values for switches may be passed to _5_r_n by
		  placing them in RNINIT.  Any switch that is set in
		  RNINIT may be	overruled on the command line, or via
		  the '&' command from within _5_r_n.  Binary-valued
		  switches that	are set	with "-switch" may be unset
		  using	"+switch".

		  If RNINIT begins with	a '/' it is assumed to be the
		  name of a file containing switches.  If you want to
		  set many environment variables but don't want	to
		  keep them all	in your	environment, or	if the use of
		  any of these variables conflicts with	other
		  programs, you	can use	this feature along with	the ----EEEE
		  switch to set	the environment	variables upon
		  startup.

		  Default: " ".

	  RNMACRO (~)
		  The name of the file containing macros and key
		  mappings.  See the MACROS section.

		  Default: %./.rnmac

	  SAVEDIR (~)
		  The name of the directory to save to,	if the save
		  command does not specify a directory name.

	  TERMCAP Holds	either the name	of your	termcap	file, or a
		  termcap entry.

		  Default: /etc/termcap, normally.

	  USER	  Your login name.  May	be interpolated	using "%L".

		  Default: $LOGNAME

	  VISUAL (~)
		  The name of your editor.

		  Default: $EDITOR

	  YOUSAID (%)
		  Gives	the format of the attribution line in front of
		  the quoted article included by an R command.

		  Default: In article %i you write:

	  When _5_r_n starts up, it looks for a file containing macro
	  definitions (see environment variable	RNMACRO).  Any
	  sequence of commands may be bound to any sequence of keys,
	  so you could remap your entire keyboard if you desire.
	  Blank	lines or lines beginning with #	in the macro file are
	  considered comments; otherwise _5_r_n looks for two fields
	  separated by white space.  The first field gives the
	  sequence of keystrokes that trigger the macro, and the
	  second field gives the sequence of commands to execute.
	  Both fields are subject to % interpolation, which will also

	  translate backslash and uparrow sequences.  (The keystroke
	  field	is interpreted at startup time,	but the	command	field
	  is interpreted at macro execution time so that you may refer
	  to % values in a macro.)  For	example, if you	want to
	  reverse the roles of carriage	return and space in rn

	  ^J   \040
	  ^M   \040
	  \040 ^J

	  will do just that.  By default, all characters in the
	  command field	are interpreted	as the canonical _5_r_n
	  characters, i.e. no macro expansion is done.	Otherwise the
	  above	pair of	macros would cause an infinite loop.  To force
	  macro	expansion in the command field,	enclose	the macro call
	  with ^( ... ^) thusly:

	  @s   |mysavescript
	  @w   w^(@s^)

	  You can use the %() conditional construct to construct
	  macros that work differently under different circumstances.
	  In particular, the current mode (%m) of _5_r_n could be used to
	  make a command that only works at a particular level.	 For
	  example,

	  ^[[O %(%m=p?\040)

	  will only allow the macro to work at the pager level.

	  %(%{TERM}=vt100?^[[O)	   /^J

	  will do the binding only if the terminal type	is vt100,
	  though if you	have many of these it would be better to have
	  separate files for each terminal.

	  If you want to bind a	macro to a function key	that puts a
	  common garbage character after the sequence (such as the
	  carriage return on the end of	Televideo 920 function
	  sequences), DO NOT put the carriage return into all the
	  sequences or you will	waste a	CONSIDERABLE amount of
	  internal storage.  Instead of	"^AF^M", put "^AF+1", which
	  indicates to _5_r_n that	it should gobble up one	character
	  after	the F.
