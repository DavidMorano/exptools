          _S_f_i_x is an interactive spelling checker/fixer.  It finds
          misspelled words in the file and presents them one at a
          time, along with the context in which they were found.  _S_f_i_x
          then makes a guess as to how the word should be spelled and
          prompts the user.  The user may let the word stand, make the
          suggested correction, supply the correct spelling, or insert
          the word in a local dictionary so that the word will not be
          flagged as mispelled in the future.

          ----dddd _c   Use the character following the -d as the default
                 response (see carriage return entry (<cr>) in the
                 commands section).  This value defaults to 'N' (see
                 the commands section).

          ----iiii     Suppress the interpretation of the nroff .so and .nx
                 commands.  This is especially useful when the files
                 concerned do not exist.

          ----vvvv     Print the sfix version number and exit.

          ----xxxx     Execute without suggesting alternate spellings for
                 misspelled words.  This option may cause sfix to run
                 more quickly on heavily loaded computer systems.

                 Use the version of _g_r_o_p_e specified by the UNIX path
                 _g_r_o_p_e__p_a_t_h.  The default path is
                 $TOOLS/lib/sfix/grope.  This option is only useful on
                 sytems such as the MH computer center machines that
                 support a version of _g_r_o_p_e.

          NNNN      No, do not make the change, and move on to the next
                 misspelled word from the spell list.

          ffff      Have sfix prompt you for the letter to begin sug-
                 gested spellings with.  (This command is not valid

                 this word into the local spelling dictionary.

                 used on every line with the error.

          ssss      Move on to the next occurence of this misspelled word
                 within the text, without changing anything.

          qqqq      Quit.  Sfix will ask whether to write out the
                 changes.

          Once sfix has completed editing a file, it will prompt you
          to find out if you want your changes, if any, to be written
          out or not.  If a 'y' or 'Y' response is returned, the
          changes will be written out, otherwise they will not.  If no
          changes were made, _s_f_i_x will terminate without writing to
          the file being checked.

          $HOME/lib/wwb/spelldict (local dictionary)

          This filename was chosen for compatibility with wwb(1).  If
          the file (or directories) do not exist, sfix will create
          them.  If you decide to manually add entries to this file,
          remember to sort it using the sort(1) command.

          _S_f_i_x uses the dictionary file used by spell,
          /usr/src/cmd/spell/list.  If this file is not present, _s_f_i_x

          When sfix is used upon formatted text, the fact that nroff
          may underline or embolden an item by placing backspaces in
          the middle of words may cause sfix to find some words that
          are not in the input text.

          Sfix defines a word "foo" as the beginning of a line or any
          non-alphabetic character, followed immediately by "foo",
          followed immediately by any non-alphabetic character, or end
          of line.  This definition _a_l_m_o_s_t always works.

          If nroff/troff control sequences are placed in the text sfix
          will not be able to find some words (e.g. the following
          method of emboldening the word would prevent _s_f_i_x from find-
          ing the word:
                    \fBword\fR

          Sfix knows a little bit about capitalization: if the first
          letter of a word in context is capitalized, the first letter
          of the replacement text will also be capitalized.  If both
          the first and second letters of a word in context are capi-
          talized the whole replacement text will be capitalized.

          If the nroff .so and .nx commands are used in the file, any
          errors in the included files will be flagged, but sfix will
          not offer to fix them.  Flagging of this misspellings can be
          avoided using the -i option.

          Since ed(1) does not handle files containing meta-
          characters, sfix will act strangely on files that include
          meta-characters.  The behavior will typically include not
          prompting for some spelling changes and not writing out
          changes that were made.
