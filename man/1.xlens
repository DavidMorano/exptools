          _x_l_e_n_s is an interactive magnification program for AT&T Dot-
          Mapped Display terminals (5620 DMD and 630 MTG) that allows
          the user to magnify any portion of a screen on the DMD.
          Magnification is done via a rectangle which takes the place
          of the mouse cursor.  The rectangle acts as a window; any-
          thing appearing in the window is displayed magnified in a
          companion window.  The user has the option of selecting the
          size and shape of the viewing window and the amount of mag-
          nification.  Magnification can range from 1x up to 50x.

          The ----VVVV option causes _x_l_e_n_s to print a message that identi-
          fies which version it is.

          The ----cccc option specifies that _x_l_e_n_s is to be stored in the
          terminal's application cache.  It is only available for the
          630 MTG.

          The mouse is used to move the viewing window around the
          screen and to select menu options. Button 1 is used as a
          toggle to turn the magnifying window on and off.  Button 2
          is used to select menu options pertaining to _x_l_e_n_s.  The
          following is a description of these menu choices:

          ggggoooo,,,, ssssttttoooopppp    This menu selection is a toggle for starting
                      (_g_o) and stopping (_s_t_o_p) xlens.  When selecting
                      _g_o from the menu, two rectangles are displayed
                      in place of the menu.  The smaller rectangle
                      (default: 50x50 pixels) is used to select the
                      area to be viewed.  As the mouse is moved, the
                      rectangle moves and thereby selects a different
                      section of the screen to magnify.  The larger
                      rectangle is the magnified view of the smaller
                      rectangle.  Magnification is initially 2x.

                      Selecting _s_t_o_p from the menu will stop _x_l_e_n_s and
                      restore the mouse cursor to the icon used by the
                      current layer.

                      Button 1 is a short cut method for turning the
                      _x_l_e_n_s off and on.  Each depression of the button
                      toggles the previous state of the _x_l_e_n_s.  For
                      example, if _x_l_e_n_s was turned on, pressing button
                      1 will turn _x_l_e_n_s off.

                      cation of the viewing window.  Each time the
                      option is selected, the window's magnification
                      is increased by the sum of the last two
                      increases; that is, the order of magnification
                      is 1x, 2x, 3x, 5x, 8x, 13x, etc.  The size of
                      the magnification is limited by the amount of
                      available memory.

                      _b_i_g_g_e_r.  The viewing window is decreased in size
                      and magnitude in the reverse order of that per-
                      formed by _b_i_g_g_e_r.  The window is reduced by one
                      increment each time the _s_m_a_l_l_e_r menu option is
                      selected.  The smallest magnification is 1x.
                      Subsequent selections of _s_m_a_l_l_e_r after 1x have
                      no affect.

                      size.  After selecting this option, the reshape
                      icon is displayed in place of the menu.  Button
                      3 is used to sweep out the new viewing rectan-
                      gle.  Clicking button 1 or 2 cancels the reshape
                      command.

                      and magnification windows are active.  It tem-
                      porarily stops the two windows from tracking the
                      mouse until a mouse button is pressed. This
                      option can eliminate the possibility of mouse
                      movement when viewing a portion of the screen.
                      Pressing any button will turn _p_a_u_s_e off.

          eeeexxxxiiiitttt        Used to exit the program, this option first
                      displays the sunset icon, giving the user a
                      chance to cancel the request.  Buttons 1 and 2
                      will cancel the request; button 3 will execute
                      it.

          Magnifying a very small window as large as possible does not
          work properly.  A magnifying window does get created but no
          magnified image is displayed in it.
