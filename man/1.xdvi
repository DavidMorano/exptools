          _X_d_v_i is a program which runs under the X window system. It
          is used to preview DVI files, such as are produced by TeX.

          This program has the capability of showing the file shrunken
          by various (integer) factors, and also has a ``magnifying
          glass'' which allows one to see a small part of the unshrunk
          image momentarily.

          Before displaying any page or part thereof, it checks to see
          if the dvi file has changed since the last time it was
          displayed.  If this is the case, then _x_d_v_i will reinitialize
          itself for the new dvi file.  For this reason, exposing
          parts of the _x_d_v_i window while _T_e_X is running should be
          avoided.  This feature allows you to preview many versions
          of the same file while running _x_d_v_i only once.

          In addition to using keystrokes to move within the file,
          _x_d_v_i provides buttons on the right side of the window, which
          are synonymous with various sequences of keystrokes.

          In addition to specifying the .dvi file (with or without the
          .dvi), _X_d_v_i supports the following command line options.  If
          the option begins with a `++++' instead of a `----', the option is
          restored to its default value.  By default, these options
          can be set via the resource names given in parentheses in
          the description of each option.

          +ppppaaaaggggeeee
               Specifies the first page to show.  If + is given
               without a number, the last page is assumed; the first
               page is the default.

               (.thorough) _X_d_v_i will usually try to ensure that over-
               strike characters (_e._g.  \notin) are printed correctly.
               On monochrome displays, this is always possible with
               one logical operation, either _a_n_d or _o_r.  On color
               displays, however, this may take two operations, one to
               set the appropriate bits and one to clear other bits.
               If this is the case, then by default _x_d_v_i will instead
               use the _c_o_p_y operation, which does not handle over-
               striking correctly.  The ``thorough'' option chooses
               the slower but more correct choice.  See also -_c_o_p_y,
               below.

          ----ccccooooppppyyyy
               (.copy) Always use the _c_o_p_y operation when writing
               characters to the display.  This option may be neces-
               sary for correct operation on a color display, but
               overstrike characters will be incorrect.

          ----kkkkeeeeeeeepppp

               should not move to the home position when moving to a
               new page.  See also the `k' keystroke.

               the margins from the left, right, top, and bottom, the
               page still cannot fit in the window, then the page is
               put in the window such that the top and left margins
               are hidden, and presumably the upper left-hand corner
               of the text on the page will be in the upper left-hand
               corner of the window.  Otherwise, the text is centered
               in the window.  See also `MMMM' under the KEYSTROKES sec-

               e.g., 1.5 or 3cm, giving a measurement in inches or
               centimeters.  By decree of the Stanford TeX Project,
               the default TeX page origin is always 1 inch over and
               down from the top-left page corner, even when non-
               American paper sizes are used.  Therefore, the default
               offsets are 1.0 inch.

          window.  Each may optionally be preceded by a (positive or
          negative) number, whose interpretation will depend on the
          particular keystroke.  Also, the "Home", "Prior", "Next",
          and arrow cursor keys are synonyms for `^', `b', `f', `l',
          `r', `u', and `d' keys, respectively.

               can be changed with the `PPPP' keystroke, below.  If no
               page number is given, then it goes to the last page.

          PPPP    ``This is page number nnnn.''  This can be used to make
               the `gggg' keystroke refer to actual page numbers instead
               of absolute page numbers.

          cccc    Moves the page so that the point currently beneath the
               cursor is moved to the middle of the window.  It also
               (gasp!) warps the cursor to the same place.

          MMMM    Sets the margins so that the point currently under the
               cursor is the upper left-hand corner of the text in the
               page.  Note that this command itself does not move the
               image at all.  For details on how the margins are used,
               see the -mmmmaaaarrrrggggiiiinnnnssss option.

          ssss    Changes the shrink factor to the given number.  If no
               number is given, the smallest factor that makes the en-
               tire page fit in the window will be used.  (Margins are
               ignored in this computation.)

          SSSS    Sets the density factor to be used when shrinking bit-
               maps.  This should be a number between 0 and 100;
               higher numbers produce lighter characters.

          RRRR    Forces the dvi file to be reread.  This allows you to

          kkkk    Normally when _x_d_v_i switches pages, it moves to the home
               position as well.  The `k' keystroke toggles a `keep-
               position' flag which, when set, will keep the same po-
               sition when moving between pages.  Also `0k' and `1k'
               clear and set this flag, respectively.  See also the

          xxxx    Toggles expert mode (in which the buttons do not ap-
               pear).  Also `0x' and `1x' clear and reset this mode,
               respectively.  See also the ----eeeexxxxppppeeeerrrrtttt option.

          If the shrink factor is set to any number other than one,
          then clicking any mouse button will pop up a ``magnifying
          glass'' which shows the unshrunk image in the vicinity of
          the mouse click.  This subwindow disappears when the mouse
          button is released.  Different mouse buttons produce dif-
          ferent sized windows, as indicated by the ----mmmmggggssss option.  Mov-

          ing the cursor while holding the button down will move the
          magnifying glass.

          Also, the scrollbars (if present) behave in the standard
          way:  pushing Button 2 in a scrollbar moves the top or left
          edge of the scrollbar to that point and optionally drags it;
          pushing Button 1 moves the image up or right by an amount
          equal to the distance from the button press to the upper
          left-hand corner of the window; pushing Button 3 moves the
          image down or left by the same amount.

          Uses the environment variable ``DISPLAY'' to specify which
          bit map display terminal to use.

          The environment variable ``XDVIFONTS'' determines the
          path(s) searched for fonts in the following manner.  The
          string consists of one or more strings separated by colons.
          In each such string, the substring ``%f'' is changed to the
          font name; ``%d'' is changed to the magnification; and
          ``%p'' is changed to the font family (``gf'', ``pk'', or
          ``pxl'').  If no ``%f'' appears in the string, then the
          string ``/%f.%d%p'' is added on the end.  For example, if
          the string is ``/usr/local/tex/fonts'' and the font is cmr10
          at 300dpi, then it searches for
          /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.300gf,
          /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.300pk, and
          /usr/local/tex/fonts/cmr10.1500pxl, in that order.  An extra
          colon anywhere in the ``XDVIFONTS'' variable causes the sys-
          tem default paths to be tried at that point.  If the font is
          not found in the desired size, then _x_d_v_i will try to find
          the nearest size.  If the font cannot be found at all, then
          _x_d_v_i will try to vary the point size of the font (within a
          certain range), and if this fails, then it will use the font
          specified as the alternate font (cf. ----aaaallllttttffffoooonnnntttt).

          For compatibility with TeX, you may also use ``TEXFONTS'' in
          place of ``XDVIFONTS'', although in that case the variable
          should not include any ``%'' specifiers.

          The ``XDVISIZES'' variable must be set to indicate which
          sizes of fonts are available.  It should consists of a list
          of numbers separated by colons.  If the list begins with a
          colon, the system default sizes are used, as well.  Sizes
          are expressed in dots per inch; decimals may be used for
          ``pxl'' files: for example, a 300 dots per inch file magni-
          fied by half a step comes out to 1643 dots per five inches,
          which should be encoded as 328.6.  The current default set
          of sizes is 300 : 328.6 : 360 : 432 : 518.4 : 622 : 746.4.
          _x_d_v_i will also try the actual size of the font before trying
          any of the given sizes.
