			    (north, south, east	or west, north is up)
			    region of the screen the first time	that a
			    window is tiled.  From that	time on, the old
			    tile position will be used.

	    tiledrag	    This option	selects	the "Drag & Tile" option
			    of tiling.	When selected, the "tile sized"
			    rectangle can be placed in the desired place
			    which is then confirmed with button-1.  e.g.

				confirmation based on option settings.
				Pressing button-3 while	the mouse cursor
				is positioned over this	gadget will
				bring up the "Exit->" menu to allow an
				exit operation to be performed on any
				host.

	    New	Window Gadget	To the right of	the host-port identifi-
				cation string is the multiplexed icon.
				This icon is now a gadget for creating
				new windows on the host	that the exist-
				ing window is associated with.	Press
				button-1 to cause the New function to be
				selected for the associated host.  But-
				ton three is used to confirm the loca-
				tion or	draw a new rectangle as	if the
				button-3 "New->" menu had been used.
				Pressing button-3 while	the mouse cursor
				is position over this gadget brings up
				the "New->" menu to allow a new	window
				to be created on any host.

	    Tile/Iconize Gadget	In the top right corner	of the wproc+
				window are two gadgets.	 The gadget on
				the left cause the window to be	"Tiled",
				or to be "iconized" (when iconize(1) is
				active and this	option is selected).
				Tiling will be discussed below.

	    Top/Bottom Gadget	The rightmost gadget in	the top	right
				hand corner of the wproc+ window is a
				top/bottom gadget.  When the layer is
				obscurred, clicking on this gadget will
				bring the layer	to the top.  When the
				layer is on top, clicking this gadget
				send the layer to the bottom.

	    Label/Drag Bar	The center of the label	bar at the top
				of the wproc+ window is	a gadget that
				allows the window to be	moved while
				pressing and holding button-2 with the
				mouse cursor positioned	in the center
				portion	of the label bar; i.e.	the area
				to the right of	the multiplexed	icon,
				and to the left	of the iconize/tile
				gadget.

	    Reshape Gadgets	The area of the	label bar which	contains
				the host label serves as a gadget for
				reshaping the wproc+ window's top and
				left sides (the	origin coordinates).

				and drag that corner to	the desired
				location.  The scroll bar region on the
				right side of the wproc+ window	can be
				used in	concert	with button-2 to perform
				the same resizing with the bottom right
				(the corner coordinates).

	    Button-2 Global Menu
				A new menu has been tied to button-2
				when the cursor	is outside of a	window,
				or when	a particular application does
				not use	button-2.  This	menu gives easy
				access to the "New" and	"Exit" menus.
				This menu also contains	a submenu for
				screen manipulation, and for options to
				_7_3_0_w_i_n_d_o_w_s.

	    New	Agent Functions	The following new agent	functions are
				supported from the host	to the terminal.
				A logical host index is	the position on
				the More->Exit with numbering starting
				at zero.  A physical host index	is the
				physical hardware index	unique to each
				physical port.	The currently documented
				physical indexes are; Host=0, Aux=1,
				Host2=2, SSI=3,	Starlan=4, TCP/IP=5,
				IDM=6.

	    The	730 MTG	ROMs support the ability to create multiple
	    "screens" to place layers onto.  This multiple screen func-
	    tionality is implemented by	changing which logical screen
	    image is displayed on the physical terminal	screen.	 The
	    swapping action can	be initiated by	holding	down the CCCCttttrrrrllll
	    key	and pressing the space bar.  Also, see the section on
	    the	SCREEN MANAGER window.

	    tion which causes a	new screen to be created.  It is not

	    Tiling refers to the operation of reducing a full size win-
	    dow	to a small icon	which is called	a "tile".  _7_3_0_W_i_n_d_o_w_s
	    supports several different variations on what happens when a
	    tile operation is selected.	 The variations	are described in
	    the	description of the associated command line option values
	    which select each variation.

	    _7_3_0_W_i_n_d_o_w_s supports	_t_i_l_i_n_g or the use of _i_c_o_n_i_z_e(_1)	to hide
	    a window away with a simple	press of button-1.  The	second
	    gadget from	the right on the top of	the wproc+ window is the
	    gadget which, when clicked,	initiates either _t_i_l_i_n_g	or an
	    _I_c_o_n_i_z_e-_H_i_d_e operation.  The use of	any of the ----ttttiiiilllleeee****
	    options deactivates	the use	of _i_c_o_n_i_z_e(_1).	By default, if
	    _i_c_o_n_i_z_e(_1) is loaded when _7_3_0_w_i_n_d_o_w_s is loaded, _i_c_o_n_i_z_e(_1)
	    will be used unless	one of the tiling command line options
	    is specified.

	    These functions are	all related to the use of 730 specific
	    virtual screens.  CCCCrrrreeeeaaaatttteeee creates a new screen that can be
	    "swapped" to by holding down control and pressing the space
	    bar.  DDDDeeeessssttttrrrrooooyyyy will delete an empty screen and "swap" to the
	    next available screen.

	    The	PPPPuuuusssshhhh item causes the mouse to switch to	a target.  Plac-
	    ing	the mouse cursor over a	layer and clicking button-2 will
	    "push" that	layer to the next screen.

	    The	PPPPuuuullllllll menu contains an item for each host, and then sub-
	    menus for all layers associated with those hosts.  Selecting
	    one	of the layers will cause that layer to be pulled to the
	    front on the current screen.

	    The	SSSSwwwwaaaapppp item causes the mouse to switch to	a target.  Plac-
	    ing	the mouse cursor over a	layer and clicking button-2 will
	    cause a new	menu to	appear under the cursor	once button-2 is
	    released.  This menu list all of the active	screens	and
	    their types.  Currently, there are two types, either "dmd"
	    or "X".  A checkmark to the	left indicates that a layer will
	    automatically "swap" to the	indicated screen when that
	    screen becomes current.  The "swapping" status can be tog-
	    gled by clicking button-2 with the mouse cursor over the
	    menu item.	When all changes are complete, click button-2
	    outside of the menu	to close the menu.

	    The	screen manager window provides a visual	interface for
	    quick access to a particular screen.  The window is	opened
	    when the "Screen Manager" option is	selected either	via the
	    Global button-2 menu, or via the "-screenmgr" command line
	    option.

	    The	image of each screen is	reproduced in micro detail
	    within this	window.	 Pointing the mouse at a particular win-
	    dow	image causes the full name of the application running in
	    that window	to appear at the bottom	of the screen manager's
	    window.  A truncated version of the	window name is placed in
	    the	rectangle representation of each window	if that

	    rectangle is big enough.  The "noseprint" font can be loaded
	    and	will be	utilized by the	screen manager to allow	more
	    characters to be displayed.

	    The	screen manager window is organized so that the top left
	    screen image is always the "current" screen.  The next logi-
	    cal	screen is to the right.	 The relative scale of the
	    screen manager's representation of each window can be
	    changed with the 'Scale' menu.  By default,	this value is
	    set	to be 5	percent	of the original	size, or 1/20th	scale.
	    Thus one pixel of information in the screen	managers window
	    represents a 20 pixel square on the	screen.

	    Button-2 brings up a menu which allows screens to be deleted
	    as well as allowing	layers to be deleted, pulled to	the
	    current screen, or swapped to.  The	screen manager window
	    can	be tiled if desired, and otherwise has all of the
	    features of	other 730windows enhanced, non-wproc windows.

	    The	confirmation button on New and Close/Exit operations is
	    not	the same button	as the one used	to initiate the	opera-
	    tion.  This	is due to the fact that	ROM routines are used
	    which originate from the button-3 menu.  Thus these	actions
	    are	selected with button-1 and confirmed with button-3.

	    The	functionality provided by this tool is heavily dependant
	    on the current ROM functionality in	that it	replaces several
	    ROM	functions with functions which provide slightly	altered
	    actions/behavior. _7_3_0_w_i_n_d_o_w_s calls some ROM	functions with
	    parameters which may change.

	    The	following "pad"	fields of the Proc structure are used to
	    store values pertainent to the functionality provided.


		 #define tiledrect(p)	 (*((Rectangle *)&((p)->pad6[0])))
		 #define untiledrect(p)	 (*((Rectangle *)&((p)->pad6[2])))
		 #define SCREENCNT(p)	 (((short *)(&(p)->pad5))[0])
		 #define TILEMAP(p)	 (*((Bitmap **)&((p)->pad6[4])))
		 #define SCREENS(p)	 (*((SCREENARR **)&((p)->pad4[1])))
		 #define SCREENMAG(p)	 ((p)->pad4[0])


	    The	following values in the	state3 field of	the Proc struc-
	    ture are used as indicated.


		 #define wasTILED    0x1       /* window has been tiled	at least once */
