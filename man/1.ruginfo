          The tools-distribution component of exptools is called RUG
          (Remote Update Gateway).  The _r_u_g_i_n_f_o command displays
          information about this distribution.  The display consists
          of two parts:

          1)  A statement about whether or not the current machine is
              part of the RUG distribution, and

          2)  If so, where its tools are supplied from.

          Of course, if a machine does not have an active exptools
          feed and has an old copy of exptools, this command won't be
          available.  If it has a more recent copy, however, the
          command will analyze the current machine and report its
          findings.  All actively fed exptools machines have this
          command.

          When reporting problems to a tool's provider, it is
          sometimes important to know how tools are fed to your
          machine.  Such information allows the provider to know where
          bug fixes should be sent.  The second part of the display
          presents this useful information.

          Here is a typical display on a machine that has an active
          RUG exptools feed:

               $ ruginfo
               This machine is a part of the RUG exptools distribution.

               This machine receives tools from 'X3b2'
               NOTE: 'X3b2' is visible to exptools providers.

          Here is the display on a machine without an active RUG
          exptools feed:

               $ ruginfo
               This machine is NOT part of the RUG exptools distribution.
