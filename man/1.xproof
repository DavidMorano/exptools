            The _x_p_r_o_o_f utility is a troff output simulator for AT&T
            Dot-Mapped Display terminals (5620 DMD and 630 MTG).  It
            reads _t_r_o_f_f output from _f_i_l_e (standard input default) and
            displays a simulation of the resulting pages on the screen.
            The amount of text displayed depends on the mode, which can
            be set from the command line:

            ----ssss   _s_c_a_l_e_d mode displays an entire page of text.  To do so,
                 it will use appropriately smaller fonts than called for
                 by _t_r_o_f_f.  This may result in illegible script, but is
                 possibly useful for getting a general impression of the
                 layout of a page.  It is the default mode.

            ----wwww   _w_i_n_d_o_w mode displays as much correctly sized text as
                 the layer can hold.

            By default, _x_p_r_o_o_f sizes the frame for displayed text with
            proportions for an 8.5x11 inch page with portrait orienta-
            tion.  The ----llll option causes _x_p_r_o_o_f to size the frame for the
            same sized page with landscape orientation (must set
            pagelength before _x_p_r_o_o_f is invoke).

            The ----pppp option causes _x_p_r_o_o_f to begin at the specified _p_a_g_e.
            The ----VVVV option causes _x_p_r_o_o_f to print a message that identi-
            fies which version it is.  The ----LLLL option invokes ligature
            simulation for the _f_f, _f_i, and _f_l ligatures.

            The ----cccc option, available only for the 630 MTG, results in
            the _x_p_r_o_o_f program being kept (_c_a_c_h_e_d) in the terminal's RAM
            memory after quitting _x_p_r_o_o_f.  The next invocation of _x_p_r_o_o_f
            will bring up the program quickly without having to download
            it.  Use the 630 MTG _u_c_a_c_h_e(_1) program to remove _x_p_r_o_o_f from
            the terminal's cache.  (Note: It is a fatal error to specify
            the ----cccc option on a 5620 DMD.)

            Fonts are loaded as required.  If the requested font is not
            available, the default font is used and the name of the
            missing font is noted in the file ////ttttmmmmpppp////....mmmmiiiissssssssiiiinnnngggg.

            _X_p_r_o_o_f supports the concept of a "directory search path" for
            finding fonts.  If the environment variable FFFFOOOONNNNTTTT contains
            one or more alternate directory paths (separated by colons),
            these will be searched for requested fonts before the
            default font directory, $DMD/font.  In addition, if the
            environment variable TTTTOOOOOOOOLLLLSSSS is set, $TOOLS/lib/xfont will be

            appended to FFFFOOOONNNNTTTT. It may be useful to set the this environ-
            ment variable in the system-wide .profile file. _X_p_r_o_o_f must
            have access to the ddddeeeeffffoooonnnntttt default font.  A return code of 5
            indicates that this file could not be found.

            When using _x_p_r_o_o_f on a 5620 DMD, after a document has been
            displayed, _x_p_r_o_o_f will enter the so-called _p_r_o_o_f_t_e_r_m mode.
            This is a simple terminal emulator that enables host com-
            mands and pipelines to be built and executed for subsequent
            proofing.  The fonts loaded by _x_p_r_o_o_f remain available until
            the user explicitly exits the program.

            The 630 MTG version of _x_p_r_o_o_f differs from the 5620 version
            in that the 630 MTG version supports the application caching
            feature of the newer terminal.  After a document has been
            displayed, _x_p_r_o_o_f exits, but since it will normally remain
            in the terminal cache, and the fonts in the terminal's font
            cache, subsequent start-up is almost instantaneous.  _P_r_o_o_f_t_-
            _e_r_m is (by default) not supported on 630 MTG terminals.

            After a layer's worth of text is displayed, _x_p_r_o_o_f pauses
            for a command.  Commands may be entered from either the host
            or the keyboard or be selected from the button 3 menu.  The
            following are recognized:

            ccccaaaarrrrrrrriiiiaaaaggggeeee rrrreeeettttuuuurrrrnnnn
                 displays the next windowful of data, which is possibly
                 the start of the following page.

            qqqq    enters _p_r_o_o_f_t_e_r_m mode on the 5620 DMD;  exits _x_p_r_o_o_f
                 and restarts the regular terminal program on the 630
                 MTG.

            xxxx    exits _x_p_r_o_o_f and restarts the regular terminal program.

            pppp _n  sets the next page to be proofed to _n.

            ssss    sets scaled mode.

            wwww    sets window mode.

            The page number should be a number or $$$$ (indicating the last
            page).  Missing numbers go to page 1.  Out of range page
            numbers are handled differently depending on whether input
            is taken from a file or a pipe.  In the former case, the
            next windowful of data is displayed.  In the later, xproof
            exits.  Since piped input cannot be backed up, when input is
            taken from a pipe, page numbers less than or equal to the
            current page cause the next windowful of data to be
            displayed instead of the requested page.  Page numbers less
            than or equal to the current page do cause the requested
            page to be displayed when input is taken from a file,

            that _x_p_r_o_o_f uses, possibly resulting in the crash of the

            ply display the next windowful of data.

            There is a maximum number of fonts (currently 50) that can
            be loaded at once.  Since each (size,typeface) tuple and
            each special character is a font, this limit can be exceeded
            in printing highly theoretical papers.

            Characters are usually positioned by words, not individu-
            ally.  Character sets that differ from _t_r_o_f_f'_s idea of their
            width will result in somewhat ragged copy.
