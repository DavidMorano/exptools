              _M_y_c_d makes it possible to change  to  different  directories
              and  then  to  remember all the directories visited.  It can
              also make use of an aliasing scheme.

              Since the _c_d(1) command must be implemented in  the  current
              shell (for DOS, see the section below for differences), this
              command must be used in with a function.  In  order  to  set
              the function to ccccdddd,,,, an alias must also be used (kkkksssshhhh only, sssshhhh
              does not have aliases).  The alias and function may be named
              whatever  you  desire,  but their functions should be set as
              follows in the environment ($$$$EEEENNNNVVVV) file when using kkkksssshhhh:
                   case $- in
                   *i*)
                        alias cd=__c_d
                        __c_d()
                        {
                             if test "X${1}" = "X-s"
                             then
                                  echo "WARNING: History NOT updated!"
                                  shift
                                  'cd' $@
                             else
                                  'cd' `mycd $@`
                             fi
                        }

                   esac
              The cd history tracking will now  take  effect  only  during
              interactive shells.  If you want it effective in _a_l_l shells,
              remove the case statement.

              The ----ssss option allows  an  escape  to  using  the  system  ccccdddd
              command  instead  of  _m_y_c_d.  This  is  an  option _m_y_c_d knows
              nothing about.  As a user, you may decide not  to  implement
              this  option, that's up to you.  It is convenient to have an
              escape mechanism in case something happens to cause _m_y_c_d  to
              operate  abnormally.   Another  way  to  escape, rather than
              _u_n_a_l_i_a_sing cd is to type ''''ccccdddd''''  including  the  quotes.   The
              alias  is now ignored.  You will notice that in the function
              __c_d, this is how ccccdddd is  executed  without  falling  into  an
              infinite loop.

              _M_y_c_d returns the path selected to standard output  on  UNIX.

              All  other  user  interfacing  (input  and  output)  is done
              directly to the terminal.  Once a directory  is  entered  in
              the  history  file,  it  will not be entered again.  It will
              simply be moved to the  new  position  within  the  history.
              This  way  the  directories that are most often accessed are
              the easiest to change back to and the least accessed sink to
              the  bottom  of the history.  It also keeps the history size
              under reasonable control.

              _M_y_c_d picks up on several exported environment variables.

              HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE        Specifies the home directory for  the  user  and
                          must be set and exported.

              CCCCDDDDHHHHIIIISSSSTTTT      Specifies the  directory  to  find  any  default
                          files  in.   Its  default  value, if not set, is
                          $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE....

                          There is a minimum number of 11110000 paths.

              CCCCDDDDAAAALLLLIIIIAAAASSSS     Specifies the file  to  use  for  aliases.   The

              CCCCDDDDOOOOPPPPTTTTSSSS      Allows  presetting   certain   options   without
                          entering  them on the command line.  Options are
                          separated with  a  colon.   For  example,  if  a
                          person  were  to want to force their menusize to
                          10 lines and always have the quiet  mode  turned
                          on, CDOPTS=e10:q or CDOPTS=q:e10.  The supported
                          options are -f, -a,  -e,  and  -q  (see  below).
                          Command line options will override these.

                          dddd _n_u_m_b_e_r Delete _n_u_m_b_e_r from  the  history.   The

                                   also have the same affect.

                          possibilities.  Should the change fail, and _p_a_t_h
                          contains  more  than  one  directory,  the  last
                          directory in _p_a_t_h is removed and the attempt  is
                          made  again.   This  continues  until  either  a
                          change is  successful,  or  there  are  no  more
                          possibilities.  The history file will be updated
                          should a change succeed.

              _p_a_t_h_1 _p_a_t_h_2 A search is made backwards through  the  history
                          file  for  a  directory  entry that contains the
                          pattern _p_a_t_h_1. If a match  is  found,  _p_a_t_h_1  is
                          replaced with the string _p_a_t_h_2 and an attempt to
                          change to the resulting directory is  made.   If
                          the  change is successful, the history file will
                          be updated.

              $CDHISTFILE

              $CDHIST/.cdhistory  This file contains only  the  full  path
                                  names to directories.

              $CDALIAS

              $CDHIST/.cdalias  This file contains the alias name, then  a
                                tab,  then  the  full  path  name  to  the
                                directory.  If this format is altered,  it
                                could  cause  serious errors.  There is no
                                reason to edit this file as _m_y_c_d  provides
                                a facility to add and delete aliases.

              There are a number of differences in implementation  between
              the  UNIX  and DOS versions of _m_y_c_d. Since DOS does not have
              the same concept of subshells that UNIX does, when a  change
              directory  is done in a program, the directory on that drive
              is changed for all other programs also.  Hence, there is  no
              need to set up the aliasing as mentioned above (though it is
              nice to alias _m_y_c_d to _c_d using _d_o_s_k_e_y  if  it  is  available
              (MSDOS 5.0+).

              Default file names have to change because  of  DOS's  naming
              conventions.   The  default  ....ccccddddhhhhiiiissssttttoooorrrryyyy is now mmmmyyyyccccdddd....hhhhiiiissss.... The

              Either slashes (unix-style) or backslashes  (dos-style)  may
              be used for directory separation.

              In addition, the environment variable HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE does not need  to
              be set.  By default, _m_y_c_d will use cccc:::://// if HOME is not set.

              The use of terminal attributes  in  the  ----llll  option  is  not
              currently  supported.   These  were  originally  implemented
              using low-level curses  routines  which  are  not  available
              under the PCcurses package I have.

              It is possible to change to a directory  pointed  to  by  an
              environment  variable.   _m_y_c_d  will  expand  $$$$vvvvaaaarrrr and use it
              correctly.  This is convenient to people familiar with  UNIX
              as DOS has no wild card expansion built into its shell.

              There are some peculiar things that  can  happen  with  this
              command.   If  multiple  users are on the same login (or you
              have multiple windows open), multiple updates of the history
              file will occur which can lead to confusion.

              Another pecular thing  that  can  happen  is  between  login
              sessions.   Say  you logout of the system while in directory
              $HOME/junk and then login back in.  Now you enter one of the
              interactive  interfaces  in  _m_y_c_d.  If you exit _m_y_c_d without
              choosing a directory, _m_y_c_d thinks  that  the  directory  you
              were  in  is  $HOME/junk  since  that  is  the  entry in the
              'current' position in the history file.

              One last thing to beware of is that the  history  file  gets
              updated  from  whatever shell or sub-shell you are in.  This
              is not like the normal _c_d as that only uses local  variables
              (not  exported  to  sub-shells).   So, if you go into a sub-
              shell from, say _v_i(1), and do some _c_ding  around,  when  you
              end  _v_i,  the  directory  you  are in and the directory _m_y_c_d
              thinks you are in may not be the same.
