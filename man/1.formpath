     NAME
          formpath - Combine components of a directory path list

     SYNOPSIS
          formpath [ -RV ] [ [ -r ] _f_i_l_e ] ...

     DESCRIPTION
          Reads the _f_i_l_es (or standard input) assuming that each  line
          contains  a  single directory name, and prints the directory
          names separated by colons to form a UNIX(Reg.) path list.

          _f_o_r_m_p_a_t_h is the inverse of _s_p_l_i_t_p_a_t_h(1).  Thus,

              VPATH=`splitpath VPATH | formpath`

          should have no effect on VPATH (except to change  constructs
          like :.: to just ::, which means the same thing according to
          UNIX(Reg.) conventions).

          A -r may preceded each _f_i_l_e which causes it  to  delete  the
          _f_i_l_e  if successfully read.  The -r must be a separate argu-
          ment from the _f_i_l_e argument, and each -r applies only to the
          very next _f_i_l_e argument only.

          The -R causes each of the input _f_i_l_es to  be  removed  after
          being  read  successfully.  It is equivalent to placing a -r
          before each _f_i_l_e name.

          The -V option reports the program  version  number,  and  if
          there are no other command line arguments, simply exits.

     EXIT CODES
          0 if OK, non-zero if a file is not readable.

     EXAMPLES
          RPATH=`ls -d /usr/rje*/job | formpath`

          might set RPATH to

          /usr/rje1/job:/usr/rje2/job:/usr/rje4/job

          or something like it.
