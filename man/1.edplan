            eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn allows the user to create, display, modify (update)
            an educational plan and submit it to a central database.
            eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn is menu-driven, and normally calls on data stored in
            a file in the $HOME directory.  It creates additional files
            in $HOME for each year for which an educational plan is
            created. eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn also allows editing and printing of a draft
            educational plan.  Educational plans may be updated as
            needed, and courses and educational activities may be added
            to the plan and modified plans resubmitted to the database
            as many times as necessary.  The user may at any time
            request a fresh copy of his/her educational plan as it
            exists in the central database.

            ----vvvv        Displays the version number of the tool.

            ----hhhh        Requests the initial "help" screen for the tool.
                      This is the default for a first-time user of
                      eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn....

            ----ffff _f_i_l_e   Calls a data file residing in the current working
                      directory.  It permits an individual to create and
                      store educational planning data for several other
                      people by specifying unique filenames for each
                      person.

            yyyyeeeeaaaarrrr      Permits the user to specify an education plan

                      and the prompt returned.  See the EXTENDED

            educational planning tool which was first released in Febru-
            ary, 1991.  The new tool differs significantly from the ori-
            ginal tool in the way it stores data in the user's directory
            structure, in the way it supports printing a paper copy of
            an educational plan, and in many small ways intended to
            respond to recommendations made by users of the original
            eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn tool.

            eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn is menu-driven, but any one of the twelve options
            available in the main menu can be called directly as an
            argument to eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn.... A direct call will exercise that menu
            option only, then return the user's prompt (that is, it will
            then drop out of eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn))))....

            The options available and their functions are:

            +o  help - Prints introductory "help" message.  This is the
               default for users lacking a .edplan file in $HOME (pri-
               marily first-time users.)

            +o  userinfo - Allows the user to modify personal data in the
               .edplan file.  Items are shown one at a time and the user
               is asked to accept the data as shown by <CR> or to enter
               corrected data.

            +o  changeyear - Allows the user to change the year of the
               plan being worked on from the default year (usually the
               current year) set by the education plan administrator.
               When called from the menu, all subsequent actions in that
               particular eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn session will be done for the year
               specified in changeyear.  Calling changeyear as an argu-
               ment to eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn does nothing, because calling a menu
               option as an argument does that one action, then returns
               to the user's prompt.  The next time eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn is called the
               defaults are reset.

            +o  showplan - Displays the user's formatted educational
               plan.  If no plan exists a message ("No plan for 199* --
               use add to create one") is displayed.

            +o  add - Allows the user to add educational activities
               (e.g., courses) to an existing educational plan.  If no
               plan exists, an empty plan is created and "add" works to
               populate that empty plan.  NNNNOOOOTTTTEEEE:::: AAAAddddddddiiiinnnngggg aaaa ccccoooouuuurrrrsssseeee ttttoooo aaaannnn

               -   vendor - Identify the organization offering the
                   course.  The most common vendors are selectable from
                   the menu by number.  If the vendor is not one of
                   those shown in the menu, enter "other" and then the
                   organization name.

               -   course number -- Give the course number provided by
                   the vendor, if available.  Nearly every formal course
                   has an identifying number; some seminars and tutori-
                   als produced locally may not.  Move on to the next
                   choice with a <CR> or <q> to return to the main menu.
                   The default is no course number.

               -   course title --  Enter the course name provided by
                   the vendor.  The default is no course title.

               -   number of contact hours -- The number of hours actu-
                   ally spent in a class, seminar or meeting.  The
                   default is 0.

               -   number of non-contact hours -- The number of hours
                   spent working on a project or course but spent out-
                   side actual class meetings.  This would include time
                   spent on breakout groups, research projects, prepar-
                   ing and writing term papers and theses, etc.  The
                   default is 0.

               -   course fee -- The amount charged for the course by
                   the vendor.  The denomination of currency used must
                   be specified ($ = U. S. dollars; # = pounds sterling;
                   Fr = French francs; DM = Deutsch marks; Dfl = Dutch
                   florins).  The default is $0.

               -   start date -- The user is first asked if the course
                   is scheduled for a specific date during the plan
                   year.  This is a "y(es)/n(o)" question, default "y."
                   Month and date are required.  If no specific date is
                   known for a course, supply the MONTH or QUARTER when
                   it is DESIRED to take the course.  Month may be given
                   as three or more letters of the name of the month
                   (either upper or lower case), or quarter specified as
                   1q, 2q, 3q, 4q, 1Q, 2Q, 3Q or 4Q.

               -   status -- The completion status that is to be
                   recorded for the course.  If the course is scheduled
                   for a date later than the present date, the status
                   will default to "P[ending.]"  Otherwise, select the
                   most appropriate status code from the menu shown.

            +o  change - Permits changing any part of the course data
               recorded in an educational plan. A one-line description
               of each course is displayed, giving the vendor designa-
               tion, the course number and title, from which the user
               may select (by number) the entry to be changed.  Very
               long lists of courses may need more screen space than is
               available.  In this case, the list is paged.  _I_t _i_s

               The tool then presents the same menu shown for "add," but
               includes as defaults each value already entered.  You may
               select the default by <CR> or enter new values.  The most

            +o  drop - Permits removal of any one course from the educa-
               tional plan.  Only courses that have not been submitted
               to the database ("Edplan Central") can be dropped, and
               only those courses are shown in this menu.

               A one-line summary of each course is shown, giving the
               vendor designation, the course number and title, from
               which the user may select (by number) the entry to be
               dropped.  Very long lists of courses may need more screen
               space than is available.  In this case, the list is
               paged.  _I_t _i_s _n_e_c_e_s_s_a_r_y _t_o _p_a_g_e _t_h_r_o_u_g_h _t_o _t_h_e _e_n_d _o_f _t_h_e

            +o  submit - Sends the educational plan to the central data-
               base ("Edplan Central").  The process is not complete
               until the data have been submitted.  All subsequent
               updates of course status, etc., must also be submitted.
               Submitting the data overwrites what is currently in the
               database.  Courses or educational experiences, once sub-
               mitted to Edplan Central, may not be deleted from the
               educational plan.  Attempts to resubmit educational plans
               with courses deleted will be rejected by Edplan Central.

               Edplan Central is "open" for at most two calendar years;
               the current year and depending on the current calendar
               date, last year or next year.  Submissions and updates
               for years other than the two open years will be rejected.

            +o  printplan - Formats the educational plan and forwards it
               to a printer.  The user may direct the output to a
               printer other than that defined in the user's .prt file;
               however the full path must be supplied.  If a <CR> is
               entered and no .prt file exists, the output will be
               directed to the system default printer.  This option can

               also be called as an argument to eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn and the resulting
               output directed to a file, which can, in turn, be
               directed to any selected printer.

               Example: edplan printplan > printfile

               The default is to print the education plan for the
               current year.  In order to print an education plan for a
               year other than the default year, the appropriate year is
               provided on the command line.

               Example: edplan 1993 printplan > printfile

            +o  request - Sends a request to Edplan Central for a copy of
               the user's educational plan as it currently exists in the
               database.  The file will be returned via electronic mail
               on the next working day.

            +o  comments - Permits the user to send comments, suggestions
               and failure reports to the edplan administrator.

            +o  merge - This option performs two key functions.  If the
               user has an existing educational plan created using the
               original version of the eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn tool (February - November
               1991), this option will convert the format of the plan in
               the user's directory to that used by the current version
               of eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn and create the necessary files.  It will be
               necessary for the user to supply the path and file name
               of the education plan data to be converted.

               This option also strips off unnecessary text from the
               educational plan returned from Edplan Central (see
               "request," above), converts the returned plan data into
               the appropriate format, and merges it with any existing
               plan data.  If the $HOME/.edplan**** (where **** speci-
               fies plan year) file currently exists, eeeeddddppppllllaaaannnn compares
               the existing file and the returned file to minimize
               course data duplication.  This option will also collapse
               duplicate course enties (see "add").

            There is a potential problem with using "printplan" on plans
            which contain more that 30 courses.  Printing plans where
            the course numbers are greater than 16 alphanumerics or
            course titles are  greater than 36 alphanumerics will result
            in overwriting of the completion status legend.  Several
            work-arounds exist;
