          _c_g_r_e_p provides all the features of _g_r_e_p, _e_g_r_e_p, and _f_g_r_e_p,
          with greatly enhanced performance (see the section on PPPPEEEERRRR----
          FFFFOOOORRRRMMMMAAAANNNNCCCCEEEE) along with many additional features, one of which
          is the ability to output the context (surrounding lines) of
          the matching lines.  The use of _c_g_r_e_p is upward-compatible
          with that of _g_r_e_p, _e_g_r_e_p (using the ----EEEE option), or _f_g_r_e_p
          (using the ----FFFF option).  _c_g_r_e_p searches _f_i_l_e_s for lines
          matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s and normally sends to standard output
          matching lines, possibly with a user-specified context win-
          dow.  The window may be specified as a constant number of
          lines before and after the matching lines (the number of
          context lines before the matching lines and the number after
          the matching lines may differ); or by specifying beginning
          and ending _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s (these may differ); or as any combina-
          tion thereof.  The windows need not be delimited at the
          nearest occurrence of _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s, as any number of matches
          to the beginning and ending _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s may be independently
          specified.  The lines delimiting the beginning or end of the
          window may independently be either included in or excluded
          from the window.

          By default, the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s and _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s are taken to be lim-
          ited regular _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s as in _g_r_e_p; however, full regular
          _e_x_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n_s as in _e_g_r_e_p, or fixed _s_t_r_i_n_g_s as in _f_g_r_e_p, may
          also be used.

          More than one _p_a_t_t_e_r_n or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r can be specified by
          enclosing the entire set of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s within
          quotes and separating individual _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s with
          newlines.  More than one _p_a_t_t_e_r_n or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r can also be
          specified by using _e_g_r_e_p mode (the ----EEEE option) and separating
          individual _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s with `||||' .  More than one
          _p_a_t_t_e_r_n can also be specified by using the ----ffff option and
          listing the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, one per line in a file.  _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s can
          also be specified dynamically from the input itself by use
          of the ----tttt or ++++tttt option.  _c_g_r_e_p also provides two special-
          purpose options, ----RRRR and ----TTTT, for scanning 5ESS.nh  ROP out-
          put.

          If no _f_i_l_e_s are specified, standard input is assumed.

          _c_g_r_e_p allows restricting matches to whole words or phrases.

          _c_g_r_e_p supports approximate matching (matching with
          mismatches allowed).  The description of the ----AAAA option
          explains approximate matching in more detail.

          Unlike _g_r_e_p, _e_g_r_e_p, or _f_g_r_e_p, _c_g_r_e_p allows the matching of
          _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s that may span multiple lines of text through the
          use of literal newline characters in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s.  The section,
          MMMMUUUULLLLTTTTIIII----LLLLIIIINNNNEEEE MMMMAAAATTTTCCCCHHHHIIIINNNNGGGG, explains this in more detail.

          The specific options recognized by _c_g_r_e_p are grouped by
          functional category in the sections that follow.  Some
          options begin with a `----' , others with a `++++' .

          Any _c_g_r_e_p option which does not take a mandatory argument
          may take an optional numeric argument, which defaults to 0000.
          The general format is ----_Q_n or ++++_Q_n, where ----_Q or ++++_Q represents
          any option that takes no argument, and _n is a nonnegative
          integer of one or more digits.  There cannot be any white
          space between _Q and _n.  The interpretation of this numerical
          value is dependent on the individual option.  Except when
          explicitly documented below, these optional numeric argu-
          ments are ignored.

          The -------- option may optionally be used to terminate the com-
          mand line options.  Each subsequent term on the command line
          is then interpreted as an argument rather than as an option,
          even if it begins with a `----' or a `++++' .

          The following two options specify the source of _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s to
          be matched.  Either option may be specified instead of the
          _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s argument.  If _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s begins with a `----' or a `++++' ,
          one of these options _M_U_S_T be specified.


          ----ffff _p_a_t_t_e_r_n__f_i_l_e
                The _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s list is taken from the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n__f_i_l_e.
          ----eeee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s
                Same as a _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s argument, but will properly recog-
                nize _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s that begin with a `----' or a `++++' .

          The following options affect the comparisons with _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s
          for determining matched lines.  Comparisons with _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s
          or _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s (see below) may also be affected.  Each of
          these options may be set independently for _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s,
          _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, and each of the two _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s.  Each option
          applies to all subsequent arguments on the command line,
          until changed by a complementary option.  These options do
          not apply to preceding arguments on the command line.  For
          example, the ----iiii option will cause upper/lower case distinc-
          tion to be ignored during comparison with _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s only if

                more detail.  (The ----xxxx1111 option does not affect com-
                parisons with _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s.)
          ++++xxxx    (default) Matches may be made to a portion of an input

                ters in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s, using
                the backslash character with a syntax like that in C
                language strings.  Any 8-bit ASCII character may be
                represented by \\\\_d_d_d, where _d_d_d is the ASCII character
                code in one to three octal digits.  Also, \\\\bbbb,,,, \\\\tttt,,,, \\\\nnnn,,,,

                space, tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage
                return, and alarm bell characters respectively.  All
                other uses of backslash represent the literal charac-
                ter following the backslash.  For example, \\\\\\\\
                represents the backslash character itself.  The ----aaaa
                option affects all uses of backslash, even those
                inside regular expression character classes (square
                brackets) and even those in _f_g_r_e_p mode.
          ++++aaaa    (default) Backslash characters are interpreted ``nor-
                mally,'' as they would be in _g_r_e_p, _e_g_r_e_p, or _f_g_r_e_p,
                depending on which mode is in effect.
          ----AAAA _n_e_r_r_o_r_s
                Allow up to _n_e_r_r_o_r_s mismatches in matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s or
                _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s.  (Comparisons with _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s are
                unaffected.)  _n_e_r_r_o_r_s must be a positive integer or
                zero.  By default, a single mismatch is either the
                insertion of an extra character in the text, a substi-
                tution of a character in the text, or a deletion of a
                character in the text.  However, portions of a fixed
                string or regular expression that are enclosed in

                NNNNOOOOTTTTEEEE:::: Angle brackets become meta-characters in all
                regular expressions or fixed strings for which approx-
                imate matching is used.  For performance reasons, it
                is a good idea to use angle brackets liberally when
                using approximate matching.  Like other meta-
                characters, an angle bracket may be escaped in a regu-
                lar expression by preceding it with a backslash, and
                an angle bracket retains its literal meaning inside of
                regular expression character classes (square brack-
                ets).  In a fixed string, an angle bracket may be
                escaped by preceding it with a backslash and using the
                ----aaaa option.

                The cost of deletions, insertions, or substitutions
                may be set independently with the ----CCCC, ++++CCCC, or ----++++CCCC
                options respectively.  These options are explained
                below.  Regardless of the cost option settings, new-
                line characters may not be inserted or substituted
                into an approximate match.  The section, AAAAPPPPPPPPRRRROOOOXXXXIIIIMMMMAAAATTTTEEEE

                which must be a positive integer.  By default, a dele-
                tion error counts as one mismatch.

                which must be a positive integer or zero.  By default,
                an insertion error counts as one mismatch.  If
                _i_n_s_e_r_t_i_o_n__c_o_s_t is zero, approximate matching is used
                even if the ----AAAA option is not used or if zero
                mismatches are specified.

          ----MMMM    If this option is specified, _c_g_r_e_p treats multiple
                input _f_i_l_e_s as a single concatenated file.  More pre-

          ----BBBB _b_u_f_s_i_z_e
                Specifies the buffer size used to read the input
                file(s).  _B_u_f_s_i_z_e (default 64) is a number in the
                range 1-64 inclusive.  The input buffer size is
                _b_u_f_s_i_z_e * BBBBUUUUFFFFSSSSIIIIZZZZ bytes, where BBBBUUUUFFFFSSSSIIIIZZZZ is a machine-
                dependent constant, typically ranging from 512 to
                4096, defined in <stdio.h>.  The buffer size should be
                decreased from the default value when _c_g_r_e_p is being
                used interactively with interactively generated input.

          The following options allow the dynamic creation of patterns
          for matching.

          ----tttt _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s
                If a line matching _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s is found on a line
                also matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s or in the context window of a
                line matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, the portion of input that
                matched _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s is saved as a fixed _s_t_r_i_n_g
                which is treated like one of the _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s for subse-
                quent matches.  Only the 16 most recently matched
                fixed strings are saved, with newly saved fixed
                strings replacing previously saved fixed strings, old-
                est first.  For example, if  ----tttt ''''EEEEVVVVEEEENNNNTTTT====[[[[0000----9999]]]]''''  is
                specified, and the string  """"EEEEVVVVEEEENNNNTTTT====6666""""  is found on a
                line also matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s or in the surrounding win-
                dow of a line matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, subsequent
                occurrences of the fixed string  """"EEEEVVVVEEEENNNNTTTT====6666""""  would gen-
                erate a context window, subject to the above limita-
                tion of 16 saved fixed strings.  This process of sav-
                ing fixed strings is recursive in the sense that
                matches with previously saved fixed strings are
                equivalent to matches with _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s for determining
                new fixed strings to be saved.  See the description of
                the ----TTTT option for another example of the use of the ----tttt
                (actually the ++++tttt) option.
          ++++tttt _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s
                This option is equivalent to ----tttt except for two differ-
                ences.  First, the context windows generated from
                fixed strings ignore +_n_l_i_n_e and terminate at the very
                next ending _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r, if specified, or at the line
                containing the fixed string itself if no ending
                _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r was specified.  Secondly, the process of
                saving fixed strings is non-recursive, in the sense
                that matches with previously saved fixed strings do
                not determine new fixed strings to be saved.  The ++++tttt
                option prevents the unexpected run-on output that may
                be produced with the ----tttt option.

          individual _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s with  `||||'  .  More than
          one _p_a_t_t_e_r_n can also be specified in any mode by using the

          The file name is normally output on each line if there is
          more than one input file, unless an option suppressing this
          output is specified.  Care should be taken when using char-
          acters from the following set - { $$$$ **** [[[[ ^^^^ |||| (((( )))) \\\\ } - in

          also meaningful to the shell.  It is safest to enclose
          _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s, or _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s in single quotes

          _c_g_r_e_p allows the restriction of matches to complete words or
          phrases.  The ----xxxx1111 option adds the restrictions that matched
          strings or regular expressions must be either at the begin-
          ning of a line or immediately following a character other
          than a letter, number, or underscore, and also must be
          either at the end of a line or immediately before a charac-
          ter other than a letter, number, or underscore.  (The ----xxxx1111
          option does not affect comparisons with _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s.)
          There is a second method to restrict matches to complete
          words or phrases.  In UNIX.nh  System V Release 4 (SVR4),
          limited regular expressions as used by _g_r_e_p(_1) have been
          enhanced by recognizing ''''\\\\<<<<'''' and ''''\\\\>>>>'''' as begin-word and
          end-word delimiters, respectively.  Similarly, _c_g_r_e_p, in

          _g_r_e_p mode, recognizes these delimiters.  The begin-word and
          end-word  delimiters are used as follows:

          ccccggggrrrreeeepppp ''''\\\\<<<<_R_E'''' _f_i_l_e_s

          will match the regular expression _R_E either at the beginning
          of a line or immediately following a character other than a
          letter, number, or underscore.

          ccccggggrrrreeeepppp ''''_R_E\\\\>>>>'''' _f_i_l_e_s

          will match the regular expression _R_E either at the end of a
          line or immediately before a character other than a letter,
          number, or underscore.

          ccccggggrrrreeeepppp ''''\\\\<<<<_R_E\\\\>>>>'''' _f_i_l_e_s

          will match the regular expression _R_E only if both the above
          conditions hold.
          Unlike _g_r_e_p(_1) in UNIX SVR4, _c_g_r_e_p recognizes ''''\\\\<<<<'''' and ''''\\\\>>>>''''
          only if used at the beginning or end of a regular expres-
          sion, respectively.

          _c_g_r_e_p is capable of matching _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s that span multiple
          lines of input text.  No special option is needed.  Inside
          character classes (square brackets) of regular expressions,
          newline characters are interpreted as literal characters.
          In regular expressions, outside of character classes, new-
          line characters must be escaped with a backslash to be
          interpreted literally rather than as separators between mul-
          tiple expressions.  Also, if the ----aaaa option is used, ''''\\\\nnnn'''' can
          be used anywhere in any mode to represent a literal newline
          character.  _c_g_r_e_p treats literal newlines as begin-line or
          end-line metacharacters.  A literal newline character will
          match the beginning or the end of any line, even if no new-
          line is present in the text.

          Multi-line matches are legal only in _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s.  They are
          illegal in _d_e_l_i_m_i_t_e_r_s and _t_r_a_i_l__p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s.  Multi-line
          matches are also illegal if any of the following conditions
          hold:
          ----    The ----tttt, ++++tttt, or ----TTTT option is used.
          ----    Back-referencing (available in ggggrrrreeeepppp mode) is used in
               _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s.
          ----    The ----vvvv option is used, _A_N_D a windowing option is also
               used.
          Also, a multi-line match will be missed if the matched text
          completely contains another shorter (single or multi-line)
          match to a pattern _A_N_D the match begins on an earlier line
          than the shorter match.  The shorter match will be found,
          however.

          _c_g_r_e_p is far superior in performance to the current versions
          of _g_r_e_p or _e_g_r_e_p or _f_g_r_e_p.  _c_g_r_e_p should be used in place of
          _g_r_e_p or _e_g_r_e_p or _f_g_r_e_p and will provide improved performance
          in almost all cases.  More specifics are provided below.
          Users of the Korn shell can achieve this performance
          improvement by aliasing as follows:

               alias -x grep="~exptools/bin/cgrep -G"
               alias -x egrep="~exptools/bin/cgrep -E"
               alias -x fgrep="~exptools/bin/cgrep -F"


          _c_g_r_e_p ranges from 30 times as fast (user time) as _g_r_e_p to
          20% slower than _g_r_e_p, depending on the expressions matched,
          options used, and number of matches found.   In a search for
          a five character fixed string, using no options, and with a
          small percentage of the lines of text containing a match,
          _c_g_r_e_p is about 8 times as fast as _g_r_e_p.

          _c_g_r_e_p slowly loses its performance advantage over grep as
          the percentage of lines matched increases.  In cases where a
          match is found on a majority of the lines in the text, _c_g_r_e_p
          typically performs comparably to _g_r_e_p, but may be up to 20%
          slower under some circumstances, in particular where a match
          is found on nearly every line.

          _c_g_r_e_p is almost completely upward-compatible with _g_r_e_p,
          _e_g_r_e_p, or _f_g_r_e_p.  The only known exception is that for
          _c_g_r_e_p, _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s that begin with a `++++' (or a `----') must be
          preceded by the ----eeee option flag or placed in a file, while
          for _g_r_e_p, _e_g_r_e_p, or _f_g_r_e_p, _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s beginning with a `++++' may
          be used directly.  When _c_g_r_e_p is used in shell scripts, it
          is a good idea to precede _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s with ----eeee.

          If _p_a_t_t_e_r_n_s begins with a `----' or a `++++' , the ----eeee option or
          the ----ffff option must be used.

          On UNIX systems, the highlighting options, ----HHHH and ----HHHH1111,
          require that the system support _t_e_r_m_i_n_f_o.  Also, the
          highlighting options may not work in non-standard windows
          (e.g. the _c_m_d_t_o_o_l_s window under OpenWindows on a Sun

          sions that use approximate matching, or in regular expres-
          sions that match multiple lines of text.  If back-
          referencing is used, only a single regular expression may be
          specified for the pattern, delimiter, or trail pattern in
          which back-referencing is used, approximate matching may not
          be used for that regular expression, and the text that
          matches that regular expression must be on a single line.

          _c_g_r_e_p uses an input buffer whose size, by default, ranges
          from 256K bytes on a mainframe computer down to 32K on a PC.
          See the description of the ----BBBB option for more information.
          The portion of any window including the matched line and all
          preceding lines not overlapping a preceding window cannot
          contain more characters than the size of the input buffer.
          If a beginning delimiter is specified rather than a constant
          number of preceding lines, this portion also cannot contain
          more than 4096 lines.  If either limitation is exceeded,
          lines will be discarded from the beginning of the portion
          until the limitations are met.

          When the ----oooo option is used, the portion of any window that
          overlaps a preceding window cannot contain more than the
          size of the input buffer.  If either a beginning or an end-
          ing delimiter is also specified, this portion cannot contain
          more than 4096 lines.  If either limitation is exceeded,
          lines will be discarded from the beginning of the window
          until the limitations are met.  If the matching line is
          itself discarded, the entire window will be discarded.
