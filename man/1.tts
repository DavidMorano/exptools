     ttttttttssss runs an AT&T-developed text-to-speech  synthesis  system
     as  an  interactive process: anything sent to standard input
     will be spoken through the synthesizer.  Related implementa-
     tions of this same software are being used in fielded appli-
     cations, including the AT&T Conversant(R)  System,  and  the
     AT&T  AI-Net(R)  System.   The  ttttttttssss  script  actually  pipes
     together two other programs:  eeeexxxxpppprrrreeeessssssss is  the  program  that
     actually   translates  the  input  text  into  a  series  of
     phonemes, and ssssppppllllaaaayyyy  is  the  program  that  translates  the
     phoneme stream into sound waves.  Both eeeexxxxpppprrrreeeessssssss and ssssppppllllaaaayyyy can
     be used separately with other  applications,  and  are  more
     fully described in the reference manual shown below.

     ----AAAA [_1-_9]          Sets  the  output  volume  level  to   the
                       appropriate  value  given as its argument.
                       1 corresponds to  minimum  volume,  and  9
                       corresponds  to  maximum  volume.  If this
                       option is not specified, then  the  output
                       volume  is  automatically  set to level 8,
                       which should be adequate for most built-in
                       speakers   on  most  SPARCstations.   (For
                       external  speakers  attached  through  the
                       SPARCstation external audio jack, the pro-
                       vider recommends a volume level  of  5  or
                       lower, depending on the characteristics of
                       the attached stereo equipment.)

     ----xxxx                Forces output through  the  SPARCstation's
                       external  audio  jack, rather than through
                       the built-in speaker.  If this  option  is
                       not  specified,  then the built-in speaker
                       is used.

                       software  you  are  using,  and  does  NOT

     In this first example, "olaf"'s electronic mailbox is  being
     sent to the speech synthesizer, which will therefore attempt
     to read all of "olaf"'s mail aloud.  Since no  options  have
     been specified, the output volume level is set to 8, and the
     built-in speaker is used.

     In this second example, the synthesizer  is  being  used  in
     interactive mode.  Whatever the user types in is echoed back
     to them as speech (in this  example,  through  the  built-in
     speaker).   The user returns to the shell by terminating the
     input stream (i.e., by typing Control-D).

     This third example uses the external audio jack,  on  volume
     level setting 5, to read aloud the contents of the specified
     file through an external stereo speaker (if any) attached to
     the SPARCstation.

     The beauty of this software is that is extremely robust, and
     does an excellent job (at least 99% of the time) in handling
     the pronounciation of ordinary English language text:  since
     it was designed for telephony applications, it is especially
     superior in its handling of proper names, telephone numbers,
     and  common  abbreviations.   However,  there  are sometimes
     situations where the user may want  to  assert  more  direct
     control  over  how the synthesizer translates its input text
     into speech.  Therefore,  you  are  strongly  encouraged  to
     study the sample input file SampleText.  Besides examples of
     how the synthesizer handles  normal  text,  this  file  also
     shows  examples  of  some  of  the more advanced programming
     techniques discussed in the reference manual.   These  tech-
     niques include user-defined dictionaries, user-defined acro-
     nyms, and manual intonation and inflection control.

     This version of the software has a small  but  annoying  bug
     associated  with  very specific types of acronyms.  Specifi-
     cally, all acronyms ending  with  the  letter  "A"  will  be
     mispronounced.   If, for example, one inputs a sentence like
     this:

          DDDDiiiissssnnnneeeeyyyy iiiissss bbbbuuuuyyyyiiiinnnngggg AAAABBBBCCCC,,,, nnnnooootttt NNNNBBBBCCCC oooorrrr CCCCBBBBSSSS....

     everything works as one would expect.  However, in this sen-
     tence:

     both of the "ATA" acronyms are pronounced as "A-T-T."   This
     problem  can  of  course be worked around by putting special
     entries into the acronym dictionary, but it shouldn't  exist
     at all.

     The current version being distributed has  only  one  (male)
     voice.   The reference manual refers to multiple voices, but
     the multiple voice capability is not yet  available  in  the
     exptools  SPARC  version of this software.  This discrepancy
     may or may not be corrected in future releases,  subject  to
     the restrictions outlined below.

     If the synthesizer is given an "escape  sequence"  (i.e.,  a
     programming  instruction,  NOT  just  English language text)
     that is syntactically incorrect, it will treat it as English
     language  text  rather  than  as  a programming instruction,
     i.e., it will SPEAK (NOT print) the  contents  of  the  mis-
     typed "escape sequence."  If the "escape sequence" is parse-
     able by the synthesizer, it will  process  it  silently  and
     without comment (so to speak).

     All other  diagnostics  (usually  technical  warnings  about
     linguistic difficulties encountered in processing a particu-
     lar phrase or sentence) are dumped to standard error.

     This software always interprets the end of a line  of  input
     to  mean  "end  of sentence," regardless of what punctuation
     might or not be present at the end of the line!   Therefore,
     if  one wants to read unrestricted, lengthy text through the
     synthesizer, one should use (or build) an  appropriate  text
     filter to get around this limitation.

     This software has no way to determine whether or  not  there
     really  is  a  speaker on the other end of its transmission.
     If you are sending output to the external  audio  jack,  and
     there is no speaker or audio cable hooked up to it (which is
     the default case on most SPARCstations!), then you will sim-
     ply  get baffling silence until you realize what the problem
     is.

     For volume settings, decimal numbers are accepted,  but  all
     figures  after  the decimal point are ignored.  Furthermore,
     any number outside the range 1-9 is interpreted to be volume
     level 9!
