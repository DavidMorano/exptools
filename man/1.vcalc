          _V_c_a_l_c is a spreadsheet calculator very similar to products
          such as VisiCalc and Supercalc available to users of
          personal computers. (VisiCalc is a registered trademark of
          VisiCorp; Supercalc is a trademark of Sorcim.)  _V_c_a_l_c is
          designed to work in the UNIX environment and is compatible
          with many popular terminals.

          _V_c_a_l_c's main utility is that values may be specified to be
          functions of other values.  Thus, when one value is changed,
          the other values dependent on it may be seen to change
          "instantaneously." You can play "What if...?" type games and
          see what happens to a modeled situation if one or more
          constituent variables or formulas are changed.

          The spreadsheet is arranged as 702 columns by 9999 rows of
          cells.  Each column is indicated by one or two letters (A,
          B, ..., Z, AA, ..., AZ, Thus, the upper left hand cell is
          A1, and the lower rightmost is ZZ9999.  See the MMMMEEEEMMMMOOOORRRRYYYY UUUUSSSSAAAAGGGGEEEE
          section for a discussion of memory usage.  At any time, the
          values of as many cells as can fit on the screen are
          displayed.

          At any time, one cell is highlighted (generally reverse
          video or underlined).  This marks the position of _v_c_a_l_c's
          cursor.  The cursor may be moved to anywhere on the sheet.
          If it is moved to a location not appearing on the screen,
          the sheet scrolls so that the new cursor position does
          appear.

          The cell at the cursor position may have its contents
          changed by one of the commands described below.  The four
          general types of cell contents are _e_m_p_t_y, _l_a_b_e_l, _r_e_p_e_a_t_i_n_g
          _l_a_b_e_l, _a_n_d _v_a_l_u_e.

          Besides the spreadsheet itself, things appearing on the
          screen include:

          ENTRY LINE
               Line One shows the contents (i.e. the formula, rather
               than the value) and format of the highlighted cell.

          PROMPT LINE
               Line Two prompts you for the next menu item or
               information to be typed for the current command.

          EDIT LINE
               Line Three holds character strings typed by you to
               represent cell contents, file names, etc.  This
               information is generally editable until you type a
               terminating character, such as a carriage return.  In
               cases where there is a default string, the edit line
               will initially show the default.  You can select the
               default by simply typing the terminator.

          AXES Axes of course identify the rows and columns being
               displayed.

          To move the cursor one cell to the left, down, up, or right,
          use your terminal's arrow keys.  If your terminal does not
          have such keys, you may use
               ^^^^HHHH, ^^^^JJJJ, ^^^^KKKK, or ^^^^LLLL,

          (Hereinafter, the arrow keys will be generally be called
          _a_r_r_o_w.)  If _v_c_a_l_c was invoked with the "----eeee" option or the
          environment variable TERM ends in "macs", you use emacs
          style cursor positioning controls
               ^^^^BBBB, ^^^^NNNN, ^^^^PPPP, or ^^^^FFFF,

          respectively.

          In general, when you want to type a coordinate, you may
          instead type a series of arrows as above.  For example, if
          the cursor is at cell A1, and you wish to type
               1111++++CCCC1111++++2222
          you may instead type
               1111++++ ---->>>> ---->>>> ++++2222
          where ---->>>> means RRRRIIIIGGGGHHHHTTTTAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW.  (The spaces in the above line
          are there just for clarity and need not be typed.)  The
          cursor moves as you type the _a_r_r_o_ws, and then goes back to
          its original position when you type the second ++++.  The
          advantage of using this method is that you can indicate a
          nearby cell without paying attention to its coordinates.

          To move more than one cell at a time, type
               >>>> _c_o_o_r_d RRRREEEETTTT
          where RRRREEEETTTT is a carriage return.  _C_o_o_r_d above may be a fully

          specified coordinate, such as BBBB11110000, or it may be partially
          specified if you wish to go to a cell in the same row or
          column as the cursor.  For example, if the cursor is at
          location B2, you may go to location B10 by typing either
               >>>> BBBB11110000 RRRREEEETTTT
          or
               >>>> 11110000 RRRREEEETTTT

          Similarly, from B10 you may move the cursor to G10 by typing
          either
               >>>> GGGG11110000 RRRREEEETTTT
          or

          To jump between windows (see the ////WWWW command), type
               ;;;;

          The <<<< command allows you to return to the first column or
          row of a table very easily.  You may think of it as the
          carriage return of a typewriter.  A margin is set by the ////WWWWMMMM
          margin command. Thereafter, the location to which the cursor
          moves depends on the last _a_r_r_o_w typed.  If the last arrow
          was a RRRRIIIIGGGGHHHHTTTTAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW, typing <<<< moves the cursor one row down and
          to the column set by ////WWWWMMMM.  If the last arrow was DDDDOOOOWWWWNNNNAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW,
          <<<< moves the cursor one column to the right and to the set
          margin's row.  If the last arrow was LLLLEEEEFFFFTTTTAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW, <<<< moves the
          cursor one row up and to the set margin's column.  If the
          last arrow was UUUUPPPPAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW, <<<< moves the cursor one column to the
          left and to the set margin's row.  Thus, to enter a table of
          numbers, you can set the left margin with ////WWWWMMMM, type the
          numbers across the first row using RRRRIIIIGGGGHHHHTTTTAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW to move across
          the row, and, when you reach the end of the first row, type
          <<<<.  The cursor will move to the first column in the second
          row.  Similarly, you can enter the table a column at a time
          with DDDDOOOOWWWWNNNNAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW and <<<<.  You can traverse the table backwards
          with LLLLEEEEFFFFTTTTAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW or UUUUPPPPAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW and <<<<.

               implementation of _v_c_a_l_c allows the reverse slash `\\\\' as

          !!!!    A one character command to recalculate the values of

               done whenever a value cell receives a new entry, but !!!!

          ////    Initiate a _s_l_a_s_h command as described below.

          Note that, in general, when an upper case (capital) letter
          is required for a menu selection, you may type either upper
          or lower case.  Lower case characters are interpreted as
          their upper case equivalents everywhere except in labels
          (and in labels, too, if the ////GGGGLLLLUUUU command has been invoked).

          These cells are displayed as blanks.  When the program
          begins, all of the cells are empty.  You may reset one or
          more non-empty cells to the blank state with the ////BBBB command
          (see below).

          Label cells display alphanumeric information about the
          sheet.  To enter a label at the cursor position, type the
          single quote character ('''') followed by the text of the
          label.  If the label text begins with a letter, the quote is
          unnecessary.  If a left-justified label is too wide to fit
          in the present cell and the cell to its right is empty, the
          text will overflow into that cell (and empty cells to the
          right of that).  Similarly, a right-justified label may
          "underflow" into empty cells to its left.  See the ////FFFF1111
          command to see how to left or right justify a cell.

          Remember that you may edit what you've typed by typing DDDDEEEELLLL
          (to erase) or ^^^^EEEE.  You also may abort the label assignment
          by typing ^^^^CCCC.

          The text string is terminated by your typing RRRREEEETTTT.
          Alternately, you may type one of the _a_r_r_o_w keys to terminate
          the string and simultaneously move the cursor one cell to
          the left, down, up, or right.

          Label and empty cells have value zero when referenced in
          arithmetic expressions.  (They are actually ignored when
          they appear in ranges in the argument lists of arithmetic
          functions.  See FFFFuuuunnnnccccttttiiiioooonnnnssss below.)  Label cells may, however,
          be referenced in value cells which perform operations on

          Repeating labels are like regular labels in every way except
          that the character or characters in them is/are repeated to
          the end of the column (without continuing into the next
          column.)

          To enter a repeating label, type """" (double quote) followed
          by the character or characters.  For example, if you want
          the cell at the cursor position to be filled with dashes,
          type
               """"----

          A value cell contains a formula for a numeric or string
          value.  The value is generally shown on the spreadsheet
          proper; its formula is shown on the Entry Line.  The
          numerical values of value cells are stored as double
          precision floating point numbers.  Enter a value cell by
          typing its formula.  For Example:
               1111++++AAAA2222****SSSSIIIINNNN((((AAAA1111****PPPPIIII))))

          Note that if the formula starts with a letter (i.e. a
          function name or coordinate), you will have to precede it
          with a plus sign so that it isn't interpreted as a label.

          Valid formula tokens are:

          ^^^^    Exponentiation operator.  For example, the value of
                    2222^^^^3333
               is 8, because 2*2*2 is 8.

          **** ////  Multiplication and division operators.

          ++++ ----  Addition and subtraction operators (unary and binary).

          <<<< >>>> ==== >>>>==== <<<<==== <<<<>>>>
               Relational operators

          &&&&&&&&   Logical And (See also the AAAANNNNDDDD function)

          ||||||||   Logical Or (See also the OOOORRRR function)

          (((( ))))  Parentheses

          _c_o_o_r_d
               A coordinate, either of the form AAAABBBB111122223333 or as a series
               of _a_r_r_o_ws.  This represents the value of the indicated
               cell.

          _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
               A function, with arguments if appropriate.  A list of
               the valid functions is given below.

          _n_u_m_b_e_r
               A number, with optional decimal places and optional
               power of 10 exponent.  An example is 11112222....33334444EEEE----4444 .

          _s_t_r_i_n_g
               A string is a series of characters enclosed in single
               quotes.  Strings, like label cells, have a numerical
               value of zero.  Thus, the value of
                    2222++++''''aaaabbbbccccdddd''''
               is 2.  Certain functions, including MMMMAAAAXXXX(((()))), MMMMIIIINNNN(((()))),
               CCCCHHHHOOOOOOOOSSSSEEEE(((()))), IIIINNNNDDDDEEEEXXXX(((()))), and IIIIFFFF(((()))), may accept arguments which
               are strings or labels.  Thus, for example, the
               expression
                    ++++MMMMAAAAXXXX((((''''aaaabbbbcccc'''',,,,''''xxxxyyyyzzzz'''',,,,''''ddddeeeeffff''''))))
               has a value of ''''xxxxyyyyzzzz''''.

               The expression
                    ++++MMMMAAAAXXXX((((''''aaaabbbbcccc'''',,,,2222,,,,''''ddddeeeeffff''''))))
               has value 2 because numbers are selected preferentially
               over strings (just as numbers and strings are selected
               preferentially over empty cells in ranges).

               Strings may also be compared by the relational
               operators.  Strings are compared according to the ASCII
               collating sequence.  Thus, ''''bbbb'''' > ''''aaaa'''', and ''''aaaa'''' > ''''AAAA'''',
               etc.  A cell whose expression evaluates to a string
               will display the string, just as if the cell were a
               label cell.

          The exponentiation operator ^^^^ has the highest priority;
          relational operators have the lowest.  Thus, the expression
               1111++++2222****3333^^^^4444
          is equivalent to
               1111++++((((2222****((((3333^^^^4444))))))))
          or 163.

          There also are two special characters that may be typed when
          you are entering an expression:

          !!!!    Replace the expression typed so far with its numeric
               value.

          ####    Replace the coordinate just typed (default is the
               present coordinate position if none was typed) with its
               value.  For example, if the cursor position cell is the
               value 16.34 and you want to add 2 to it, you may type
               ####++++2222 RRRREEEETTTT
          The new cell expression (and value) will be 18.34 .

          If you type a character inappropriate for the expression, an
          error message will be displayed, and the character will not

          Like labels, value entries are terminated with RRRREEEETTTT or an

          Function names are character strings.  Some functions
          require one or more arguments in parentheses; others do not
          take arguments.

          In the list below, the following nomenclature is used:

          _v    Any value, such as a number, coordinate, function, or
               expression.

          _l    Any logical value.

          _l_i_s_t A combination of values and ranges separated by commas.

          _r_a_n_g_e
               A number of contiguous cells, specified by the
               beginning coordinate, a dot (displayed as an ellipsis),
               and the end coordinate.  For example,
                    AAAA11110000........AAAA22220000
               means "all of the cells between AAAA11110000 and AAAA22220000,
               inclusive."
                    AAAA11110000........CCCC22220000
               means all of the cells in the block or rectangle bound
               by AAAA11110000 at the upper left and CCCC22220000 at the lower right.

               Note that empty or label cells in ranges in function
               argument lists are ignored.  Thus you may "double
               space" entries if you so desire.  You also may put
               blank cells or labels on either end of a range and then
               not have to worry about retyping expressions
               referencing the range if you later insert or delete
               rows or columns at the ends (see ////IIII and ////DDDD).

          The functions and special values are:

          FFFFAAAALLLLSSSSEEEE
               The logical value FALSE This is identical to the number
               0.

          TTTTRRRRUUUUEEEE The logical value TRUE.  This is identical to the
               number 1.

               expressions with illegal computations (such as dividing

               The function's value is the value of the _vth element in

          ////BBBB   Blank - Erase a cell or cells to EMPTY.  You will be
               prompted for the range of cells to be blanked.  Type
               the desired coordinate or range, and terminate the
               command with RRRREEEETTTT.  The default is just the cell at the
               cursor position.  That is, if you do not type a
               coordinate or range, _v_c_a_l_c will take the default action
               of blanking the cell at the cursor position.

          ////CCCC   Clear - Clear the worksheet, and revert to initial

               information.  First you are asked for a number
               indicating the number of rows or columns to be deleted.
               If you do not type a number, 1 is assumed.  Follow the
               number (or lack thereof) with RRRR or CCCC to indicate
               whether you wish to delete rows or columns.  Finally,
               you are asked for an indication of where to delete
               from.  Type a coordinate or range followed by RRRREEEETTTT.  The
               default is the row or column in which the cursor rests.

               For example:
                    ////DDDD 2222 RRRR 11115555 RRRREEEETTTT
               means that you want to delete two complete rows
               starting at row 15.  Rows 15 and 16 are deleted.

                    ////DDDD 2222 RRRR CCCC11115555........EEEE11115555 RRRREEEETTTT
               deletes two partial rows.  Cells C15..E15 and C16..E16
               are deleted.

               Cells below or to the right of the deleted area are
               shifted up or to the left to fill in the created gap.
               All references throughout the worksheet to coordinates
               in the area below the deleted area are adjusted to
               reflect their shift in position.  Any references to the
               deleted area itself receive the value EEEERRRRRRRROOOORRRR.

          ////EEEE   Edit - Allow editing of the contents of the cell at the

               cell, RRRRIIIIGGGGHHHHTTTTAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW moves you one cell forward, UUUUPPPPAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW

               puts you at the end.  DDDDEEEELLLL erases the character to the
               left of the edit cursor, and any other character will
               be added at the cursor position.  Terminate it all with
               RRRREEEETTTT.

               If you are editing a value cell and you introduce a
               syntax error into the expression, the error will not be
               noticed until you type RRRREEEETTTT.  You will then see an error
               message, and you will remain in edit mode, with the
               cursor at the position immediately after the error.

               Recall that you may enter the edit mode while initially
               entering a cell expression (or other data to be
               terminated by RRRREEEETTTT) by typing ^^^^EEEE.

          ////FFFF   Format - Specify the format of a cell or cells.

               Specify the domain for the format specification with
               one of the characters EEEE, CCCC, RRRR, or WWWW:

               EEEE    indicates that the specification is valid for the
                    single entry only.

               CCCC    indicates that it applies to the entire column,

               RRRR    that it applies to the row, and

               WWWW    that it applies globally to the present window
                    (see ////WWWW).

               In case of conflict, the entry specification has
               highest priority, followed by column, row, and window
               with lowest priority.

               You must then enter the relevant format specifications
               for the specified domain.  Enter one or more of these
               specifications, followed by a RRRREEEETTTT or an _a_r_r_o_w.
               Possible specs are:

               DDDD    Default - Default to the specs of the next lower
                    priority domain.

               EEEE    Exponential - Force the entry to be in exponential
                    format (scientific notation).

               FFFF    Fixed - Force the entry to be in fixed point
                    format.  That is, it will never be in exponential
                    format.  For example, the value 31.4 will be
                    displayed as 3333....11114444eeee1111 in EEEE format and as 33331111....4444 in FFFF
                    format.

               GGGG    General format - Display values in either fixed or
                    exponential format, depending on which will show
                    the most significant figures.

               ,,,,    Comma format - Display values exactly as in the FFFF
                    fixed format, but with commas separating thousands
                    to the left of the decimal point.  Thus, 1000000
                    is displayed as 1,000,000 with the comma format.

               ****    Graph format - Replace values with an appropriate
                    number of stars.

                    Note that EEEE, FFFF, GGGG, and **** are mutually exclusive.
                    If one of those has been specified and you wish to
                    instead default to the spec of the next lower
                    priority domain, type the appropriate character
                    followed by DDDD.

               LLLL    Left - Align entries with the leftmost column of
                    their cell.  This is the default alignment for
                    labels and ****'s.

               RRRR    Right - Align entries with the rightmost column of

                    the appropriate character followed by DDDD.

               PPPP    Specify the number of decimal places with EEEE and FFFF
                    formats.  You may type a number between 0 and 13.
                    Alternatively, you may type VVVV to specify that the
                    precision should be varying, according to how many
                    significant decimal places can fit in a column.
                    Finally, you may type DDDD to indicate the precision
                    should default to that of the next higher domain.
                    Note that the precision is ignored when the GGGG or ****
                    spec is enabled.

               CCCC    Specify the column width (valid only with global
                    and column domains).  Follow the CCCC with a number,
                    which must be greater than or equal to 3 and less
                    than or equal to the present window width.  For
                    the column domain, you may type DDDD instead of a
                    number in order to default to the global width.

               WWWW    Specify write protection for the indicated
                    cell(s).  Follow WWWW with YYYY to enable write
                    protection, NNNN to disable protection, and DDDD to use
                    the default.  A write protected cell may not be
                    overwritten by a succeeding command or operation.
                    If you try to change the contents of a write
                    protected cell, _v_c_a_l_c will ask you if you really
                    wish to change it.  The change will take place
                    only if you respond with YYYY.

               For example,
                    ////FFFFEEEEFFFFPPPP2222
               indicates that you want the cell at the cursor position
               to have two decimal places in fixed format.

                    ////FFFFWWWWCCCC6666 RRRREEEETTTT
               indicates that you want the window containing the
               cursor to have columns 6 characters wide.

                    ////FFFFCCCC****RRRRPPPPDDDDCCCCDDDDWWWWYYYY
               indicates that you want the column containing the
               cursor to have right aligned "star" format, with
               default decimal places and column width, and write
               protection turned on.

               The initial state of the sheet is:

               for all rows, columns, and entries.

          ////GGGG   Global - Specify or display global parameters and
               flags.

               ////GGGGOOOO  Order of recalculation.  Normally, when the values
                    on the sheet are calculated, the program runs down
                    the first column, then down the second column, and
                    so on to the last column.  But your data may be
                    arranged so that the value of one cell depends on
                    the value of a cell to its right.  In case, the
                    value of the dependent cell will not be right
                    after one pass through the sheet.  For example, if
                    you have
                         A1: 20          B1: 10+A1
                         A2: 5*B1        B2: whatever
                    you can see that if you type a new value for A1
                    the new value for A2 will be calculated before B1
                    is recalculated.  Since A2's new value depends on
                    the new value of B1, A2's value will be wrong.  If
                    you type !!!!, the sheet will be recalculated, and A2
                    will get the proper value because it will use B1's
                    new value this time.  But there is a better way to
                    handle this situation.  You can type
                         ////GGGGOOOORRRR RRRREEEETTTT
                    to specify that the calculations are to proceed in
                    "row major order", i.e.  that the first row will
                    be calculated, then the second row, and so on to
                    the last row.  You of course may reset the order
                    to the default with
                         ////GGGGOOOOCCCC RRRREEEETTTT

                    In the interest of efficiency, it is recommended
                    that you arrange the formulas in your sheet so
                    that they will all receive the proper values in
                    one pass, either in row major or column major
                    order.  But there may be some instances where this
                    is not possible.  In these cases, you may specify
                    multiple passes.  For example,
                         ////GGGGOOOORRRRCCCC RRRREEEETTTT
                    specifies that the sheet is to be calculated twice
                    on recalculations.  The first calculation is in
                    row major order, the second in column order.  You
                    may have any combination of R's and C's, but
                    remember that each pass adds to the time of
                    recalculation.

               ////GGGGRRRR  Automatic recalculation flag.  Normally, whenever
                    a value cell is written to, the entire sheet is
                    recalculated.  This is an important feature of

                    want to enter a lot of data without having to wait
                    for the values to be recalculated and the screen
                    redrawn for each entry.  Disable the automatic
                    calculation by typing
                         ////GGGGRRRRMMMM

                    You can still do recalculation manually with the !!!!
                    command, and you can reset automatic calculation
                    with

                    These parameters include the column, row, and

                    the amount of memory used in storing the sheet.
                    The information remains on the screen until you
                    type a character for the next command.

               ////GGGGLLLL  Label upper/lower case flag.  You may want all or
                    most of your labels to be in upper case
                    (capitals).  This flag allows you to type lower
                    case letters and have them appear as upper case in
                    the labels.  (When you hit the shift key, the
                    upper case letters you type are mapped to lower
                    case.)

                    This flag is initially disabled, so that label
                    characters are stored "as typed".  To turn it on,
                    type
                         ////GGGGLLLLUUUU

                    To turn it back off, type

          ////HHHH   Help - Display a rudimentary help screen describing the
               top level command functions.

          ////IIII   Insert - Insert one or more empty partial or complete
               rows or columns.  You are prompted for a number, an RRRR
               or a CCCC, and a range indicating where the new cells are
               to be inserted.  As in the ////DDDD delete command, 1 is the
               default number, and the present row or column is the
               default position.

               For example, if you type
                    ////IIII 2222 RRRR 11115555 RRRREEEETTTT
               two new rows will be inserted above row 15.  If you

               above D15, and two above E15.

               Cells at and beyond the insertion position are shifted
               down or to the right to make way for the insertion.
               All references throughout the worksheet to coordinates
               in the area below to the right of the inserted area are
               adjusted to reflect their shift in position.

          ////MMMM   Move - Move one or more partial or complete rows or
               columns to another position in the sheet.  You will be
               prompted for a number, RRRR or CCCC, and two ranges.  The
               first range indicates the starting location of the
               moved cells, and the second range indicates the end
               location.

               For example, if you type
                    ////MMMM 2222 RRRR 11115555 RRRREEEETTTT 22220000
               rows 15 and 16 will be moved to the position before row
               20, i.e. between rows 19 and 20.  Row 17 will be
               shifted up into the row 15 position, 18 into 16, and 19
               into 17.  The old 15 thus becomes row 18, and 16
               becomes row 19.

               If you type
                    ////MMMM 2222 RRRR 11115555 RRRREEEETTTT 11110000
               rows 15 and 16 are moved to the position before row 10,
               i.e. between rows 9 and 10.  Rows 10 through 14 are
               shifted down to make room.

               If you type
                    ////MMMM 2222 RRRR CCCC11115555........EEEE11115555 RRRREEEETTTT 11110000
               the six cells C15..E15 and C16..E16 are moved to above
               row 10.

               All references throughout the worksheet to coordinates
               in the area affected by the move are adjusted.

               Note that rows may be moved down or up and columns left
               or right.  There is no way to move a group of cells
               simultaneously down and to the right.

          ////PPPP   Print - Print all or part of the sheet.  You first are
               prompted for options.  If the default options are
               satisfactory, just type RRRREEEETTTT.  To change one or more
               options, type OOOO.  The options that appear are:

               After typing an option, you may type a colon (`:') to

               specifying the options, type RRRREEEETTTT to return to printing,
               or type QQQQ to quit the print command.

               You are prompted for the range of cells to be printed.
               The default is the whole sheet.  You will then be
               prompted for an FFFF or PPPP, specifying whether you want to

               Note that the "program" may actually be a UNIX

               in between.  Both the source and destination may be
               single coordinates or ranges.

               For example, to copy cell AAAA2222 to DDDD11110000, type
                    ////RRRR AAAA2222 RRRREEEETTTT DDDD11110000 RRRREEEETTTT

               To copy column AAAA1111 through AAAA22220000 to a position beginning

               Location AAAA1111 will be copied to BBBB1111, AAAA2222 to BBBB2222, etc.

               If the destination is a range, the source cell or cells
               will be copied multiple times.  The source block will
               be copied to a group of adjacent block positions, each
               of whose upper left hand corner is in the specified
               destination range.  For example, to copy cell A1 to the
               whole sheet (not recommended), type
                    ////RRRR AAAA1111 RRRREEEETTTT AAAA1111........ZZZZZZZZ9999999999999999 RRRREEEETTTT

               MMMM6666..PPPP6666, etc.

               To copy block AAAA1111........BBBB2222 to the four locations beginning at

               If a coordinate is omitted, it is assumed to be the
               present location.  For example, if the cursor is at AAAA1111,
               you may copy AAAA1111 through AAAA11110000 to the position beginning
               at DDDD1111 by typing
                    ////RRRR ....AAAA11110000 RRRREEEETTTT DDDD1111 RRRREEEETTTT
               The "default" coordinate will be displayed to remind
               you that you've indicated it.

               When you copy a formula that has coordinates in it, you
               may want the coordinates in the copy to be adjusted to
               take account of that fact.  For example, if cell AAAA1111 has
               the value 1 and cell AAAA2222 has formula 1+A1 and value 2,
               you may want to put 1+A2 in cell AAAA3333 and so on down to
               1+A19 in AAAA22220000 so you'll have a column of the numbers 1
               through 20.  You may type
                    ////RRRR AAAA2222 RRRREEEETTTT AAAA3333........AAAA22220000
               You then will be prompted with a question asking
               whether you want AAAA2222 in the formula to be copied "No
               Change", "Relative", or "Value".  Type RRRR to make the
               coordinate in the copy relative to its new position.
               If you had wanted the coordinate to remain as AAAA1111, so

               you'd get the value 2 in A3..A20, you would have typed
               NNNN for no change.  You will be similarly prompted for
               each coordinate in each formula in the source range.
               You may precede the NNNN or RRRR with a number to indicate
               that you wish the NNNN or RRRR to apply for that number of
               coordinate references.  This saves you having to type
               the same response time after time.  You may also
               precede the response with **** to indicate that the
               response applies for the remainder of the coordinate
               references in the replicate.

               You may type VVVV if you want expressions involving
               coordinates to be copied so that they are converted to
               their values alone.  For example, if cell AAAA3333 is the
               expression 1+A2, evaluating to 17, you may place the
               value 17 into cell BBBB3333 by typing
                    ////RRRR AAAA3333 RRRREEEETTTT BBBB3333
               and typing VVVV when _v_c_a_l_c asks you for the disposition of
               the coordinate.

               ////SSSSSSSS   Save a copy of the sheet in a UNIX file.  You
                    will be prompted for a file name.  Type the name,
                    followed by RRRREEEETTTT.  The file name may include shell
                    metacharacters such as **** and ????, and may include
                    shell variables such as $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE.  If the file
                    already exists, you will be prompted for a YYYY to
                    confirm that it's okay for the file to be
                    overwritten (this confirmation is unnecessary if
                    the file is being written by a command file
                    executed by ////SSSSLLLL (see below)).  Saved information
                    includes the formulas and formats of all the

                    flag.

               You may specify that ////SSSSSSSS output is to be to a pipe to
               another program rather than a file by typing the
               program preceded by the `|' character when you are
               prompted for the file name.

                    saved file had data in those positions.  You can
                    also use the ////SSSSLLLL command to execute a series of

                    You may specify that ////SSSSLLLL input is to be from a
                    pipe to another program rather than a file by
                    typing the program preceded by the `|' character
                    when you are prompted for the file name.

                    Note that specifying a file name on the command
                    line in invoking _v_c_a_l_c is similar in effect to
                    typing ////SSSSLLLL_f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e as the first command.

               ////SSSSRRRR   Read data from a non-_v_c_a_l_c format ASCII file.
                    You may wish _v_c_a_l_c to read a table of numbers
                    and/or labels that were produced by another
                    program or by a standard text editor.  The ////SSSSRRRR
                    command reads a file of data items separated by
                    some delimiter.

                    You are first prompted for one or more delimiters.
                    Type the delimiters, followed by RRRREEEETTTT.  For
                    example, if your input file consists of a list of
                    numbers separated by commas, type a comma and RRRREEEETTTT.
                    The default delimiter is TTTTAAAABBBB.  Note that if two
                    delimiters are read without intervening
                    characters, a column is skipped.  For example,
                    2222,,,,,,,,6666 is interpreted as 2, skipped column, 6.  This
                    rule is not true for the SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE character as a
                    delimiter.  That is, two or more adjacent SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEEs
                    character delimiters are the same as one SSSSPPPPAAAACCCCEEEE.

                    You next are prompted for characters to be
                    ignored.  For example, if the input file has
                    dollar signs in front of numbers, you'll want to
                    specify that dollar sign is to be ignored because
                    _v_c_a_l_c does not understand the meaning of these
                    characters.

                    You are then prompted for the upper left hand
                    corner of the region to receive the input.  Type a
                    coordinate followed by RRRREEEETTTT.  The default position
                    is the cursor position.

                    You finally are prompted for a file name.  Type
                    the name followed by RRRREEEETTTT.

                    Successive lines in the input file are read into
                    successive rows in the spreadsheet.

               ////SSSSDDDD   Change directory.  You are prompted for a
                    directory name.  Type a name followed by RRRREEEETTTT.
                    $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE is the default.

               some column headers or other titles way up in the upper
               left of the sheet in view.  The title fixing feature
               tells the program that you want certain rows and/or
               columns to stay put while you scroll through the rest
               of the sheet.  The way to do this is to move the cursor
               to the lower right of the region you want to fix in
               place and type:
                    ////TTTTAAAA RRRREEEETTTT or ////TTTTLLLL RRRREEEETTTT or ////TTTTAAAALLLL RRRREEEETTTT

                    cursor position and a window to the right.

                    After the ////WWWW command executes, the cursor will be
                    in the first (left/upper) window.  Type the
                    character ;;;; to jump back and forth between the
                    windows.

               ////WWWW1111  returns the screen to the single window state,
                    effectively undoing a ////WWWWVVVV or ////WWWWHHHH.  The single
                    window has the attributes of the window that the
                    cursor was in at the command's invocation.

               ////WWWWSSSS  synchronizes scrolling.  Thus, when one window
                    scrolls, the other one will also (for example, you
                    may want to simultaneously examine the same rows
                    in two distant columns).  With vertically
                    separated windows, up and down scrolling will be
                    synchronized.  With horizontally separated
                    windows, right/left scrolling will be
                    synchronized.

               ////WWWWUUUU  to disables the synchronization feature
                    (unsynchronizes the windows).

                    prompted for the position where the margin is to
                    be set.  Type a coordinate followed by RRRREEEETTTT.  The
                    default is the current cursor position.

          ////ZZZZ   Zone/Scroll - Shift the worksheet so that a different
               portion is displayed on the screen.

               A window is scrolled by following ////ZZZZ with an arrow
               indicating the direction of scrolling.  For example, if
               the screen currently displays columns AAAA through HHHH, and
               the cursor is at position DDDD11110000, and you'd like to look
               at column IIII while keeping the cursor in column DDDD, you
               can type
                    ////ZZZZ RRRRIIIIGGGGHHHHTTTTAAAARRRRRRRROOOOWWWW

               The cursor stays at the same cell if that position is
               still on the screen.  The arrow may be preceded by an
               integer if you wish to scroll more than one column or
               row at a time.

               A second flavor of the ////ZZZZ command allows you to shift
               the worksheet so that the coordinate on which the
               cursor lies is in one of 9 positions on the screen.
               Follow the ////ZZZZ with a digit
                    1111 2222 3333
                    4444 5555 6666
                    7777 8888 9999

               and then RRRREEEETTTT.  For example, ////ZZZZ1111 will put the cursor in
               the upper left corner of the screen, ////ZZZZ2222 puts it at the
               upper center, ////ZZZZ5555 puts it at the center, etc.

               Note that the movement may only be approximate and that
               there are constraints placed by the size of the sheet.
               For example, with the cursor at AAAA1111, typing ////ZZZZ9999 will
               have no effect because there are no cells which can
               appear to the upper left of AAAA1111.  Also, the zone command
               has no effect if the cursor is in an area fixed in
               place by the ////TTTT command.

          ////!!!!   Shell escape - Execute a single command via the UNIX
               shell.  Type ////!!!! and a command name.  The screen will be
               cleared and the command will execute.

               If you want to execute an interactive shell, type
                    ////!!!!sssshhhh

               When the command finishes, type any character to redraw
               the worksheet, or type another !!!! to execute another
               shell escape.

               to where you pointed.  (This may change to allow some

               will move to that cell in the other window.

               Any mouse pointing is ignored.

          If you are in LABMODE:

               are included into the value.

               If you are in two window mode and you sweep a region
               that is across both windows, it picks one cell from
               each window to compose the region.  This MAY make
               sense, but I wouldn't count on it.

          version a particular file is.

          Some arithmetic overflow conditions are not caught.

          -x^n (unary minus) is treated as (-x)^n instead of -(x^n)

          ////WWWWVVVV with cursor in last column on screen is buggy for
          certain column width combinations.

          Terminal character insert/delete capabilities are not
          exploited.

          Repeating labels referenced in value cells act like non-
          repeating labels, i.e. the expression
               ++++AAAA1111
          where A1 is the repeating label """"---- , displays as a single
          dash.

          Doesn't handle "standout" (e.g. reverse video) mode properly
          for some terminals.  For some terminals this fault is
          recognized automatically, and standout mode is disabled.
          For others, you must explicitly disable it with the ----ssss flag.
          For some terminals, there are only intermittent problems,
          which can be cleared up by typing ^^^^RRRR to redraw the screen.

          _V_c_a_l_c uses terminal insert and delete capabilities to
          optimize screen redrawing in some cases.  This capability
          has been tested on some, but not all, terminals.  If you
          find that your screen is sometimes corrupted by cursor
          motions, invoke _v_c_a_l_c with the ----iiii flag; this should clear it
          up.  Please report such problems to the author.

          The program can be very picky about what value you give to
          your $TERM variable.  For example, specifying TERM=hp when
          you should have TERM=2621 or vice versa will cause standout
          problems.

          Some terminals send ^| for their arrow keys.  People using
          these terminals must make sure that their terminal "Quit"
          character is set to something else.
