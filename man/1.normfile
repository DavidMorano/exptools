     NAME
          normfile - Normalize file names to their shortest legal form

     SYNOPSIS
          normfile [ -kV ] _f_i_l_e__n_a_m_e ...

     DESCRIPTION
          Normalizes file names, shortening them to the shortest legal
          form.   This  process is described below.  Each of the argu-
          ment _f_i_l_e__n_a_m_es is normalized and output on a separate line.
          Empty file names are output as is (with no error message).

          The process  of  normalizing  a  file  (or  directory)  name
          entails:

          _S_T_E_P:                                _B_E_F_O_R_E:   _A_F_T_E_R:
          1. Extraneous slashes are removed.   a///b     a/b
                                               abc/      abc
          2. . and .. are removed              a/../b    b
                                               a/./b     a/b
                                               /..       /
          or changed,                          a/..      .
          except those that shouldn't be.      ../a      ../a
                                               .         .


          The -k option causes it to skip step 2.  Thus,  only  redun-
          dant slashes are eliminated; but extraneous .  and .. refer-
          ences aren't removed.

          The -V option reports the program  version  number,  and  if
          there are no other command line arguments, simply exits.

     EXIT CODES
          -1 on a usage message, otherwise the  number  of  _f_i_l_e__n_a_m_es
          that  were  empty,  or that had too many path components for
          _n_o_r_m_f_i_l_e.
