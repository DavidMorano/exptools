          _M_a_c_g_e_t receives a file from a Macintosh running MacTerminal.
          The File Transfer settings should specify the "Modem7"
          transfer method and a "MacTerminal" remote system.  This
          program is designed for use with the 1.1 Release version of
          MacTerminal, or other terminal emulators that support either
          Mac XModem or MacBinary XModem protocols.

          To use this program, log into the unix system using
          MacTerminal, start macget with the desired options, select
          "Send File..." from the "File" menu, and open the file you
          wish to send.  If MacTerminal is properly configured, it
          will put up an indicator showing how much of the file has
          been transferred.  Several Control-X's may be used to force
          macget to give up if the transfer fails.

          The optional _f_i_l_e parameter specifies the name to use when
          creating the unix files, otherwise the Mac file name is used
          (with spaces converted to underscores).

          If none of the ----rrrrdddduuuu flags are specified, _m_a_c_g_e_t creates
          three unix files from the received Mac file:  _f_i_l_e....iiiinnnnffffoooo,
          _f_i_l_e....ddddaaaattttaaaa, and _f_i_l_e....rrrrssssrrrrcccc.  This mode is useful for storing
          Mac files so they can be restored later using _m_a_c_p_u_t.

          The ----rrrr flag specifies _r_e_s_o_u_r_c_e mode.  Only _f_i_l_e....rrrrssssrrrrcccc will be
          created, from the Mac file's resource fork.

          The ----dddd flag specifies _d_a_t_a mode.  Only _f_i_l_e....ddddaaaattttaaaa will be
          created, containing the data fork of the Mac file.

          The ----xxxx flag causes macget to create a single "MacBinary"
          file instead of the normal three files.  This single file
          can be up loaded to a mac using macput -x.

          The ----uuuu flag requests _u_n_i_x mode, in which carriage returns
          are converted into unix newline characters, and the unix
          file _f_i_l_e....tttteeeexxxxtttt is created.  A file saved from Mac
          applications as "text only" can be transferred using this
          option to convert it to a normal unix text file.

          The ----UUUU flag is the same as the ----uuuu flag except that the
          result filename has no .text part.

          The ----bbbb flag causes macget to use the MacBinary xModem
          protocol, it will also attempt to use CRC16 instead of
          checksum.

          The modem7 protocol will not work over flow controlled
          communication lines, some terminal concentrators, or when
          using rlogin.

          MacTerminal Beta versions 0.5 and 0.9 incorrectly calculate
          record checksums under certain circumstances, preventing
          some files from being successfully transferred; this bug has
          been fixed in the released version 1.1.
