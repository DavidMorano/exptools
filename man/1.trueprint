	  _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t is a general purpose program printing program.  It
	  tries	 to  produce  everything  that anybody could need in a
	  program printout without  the	 need  for  large  numbers  of
	  switches or pipelines, and as	such it	replaces xcl(exptools)
	  and cpr(exptools).  _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t	 can  currently	 handle	 C/C++
	  source, 5ESS(Tm) breakpoints,	ECMS cmspr output, pascal pro-
	  grams, 5ESS prl5 poprules, shell scripts (including csh  and
	  ksh),	Lisp and Version Editor	(ve) print dumps.

	  Each page in the output  has	a  _h_e_a_d_e_r  consisting  of  the
	  current  date	 or  a user-defined string, (which may contain
	  finfo(exptools) format directives), the current  title,  and
	  the  overall page number (which is used in the indexes); and
	  a footer consisting of the date, the current file  name  and
	  page	number	within file, and the overall page number.  The
	  current _t_i_t_l_e	is normally the	function at  the  top  of  the
	  page or for pascal programs, it may be the current sub-title
	  as given in the %S compiler directive.

	  The printout has two _i_n_d_e_x_e_s	at  the	 front.	 The  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n
	  index	 is  an	 alphabetically	 sorted	list of	all functions,
	  showing the file the function	was found in.  The _f_i_l_e	 index
	  is  a	 list of files,	expanded to their full path-name, with
	  functions in each file sorted	into alphabetical order.

	  There	is an optional _N_C_S_L summary printed after the indexes.
	  This	shows  statistics for each file, on the	non-commentary
	  part of the source being printed,  in	 the  same  format  as
	  ncsldiff(exptools).  Please  be aware	that with this option,
	  only NCSL additions and deletions will be shown in the prin-
	  tout.

	  The _t_e_x_t of the printout has line numbers with  the  current
	  braces depth (by default only	for C/C++ and pascal) down the
	  left hand side.  Function names and C++ class	names  are  in
	  _b_o_l_d	and  comments  are in _i_t_a_l_i_c_s. Long lines are split at
	  _b_r_e_a_k	characters (;({,. ^I), folded onto the	next  line  at
	  the current indentation, then	split again, if	necessary, and
	  the result _r_i_g_h_t justified. This action  is  to  attempt  to

	  print	 the  code  in	similar	fashion	to the accepted	coding
	  methods generally in use, rather than	use  traditional  wrap
	  around  that	no-one would ever use in producing the code in
	  the first place!

	  Each _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n	starts on a new	page - or more accurately each
	  function  ends  on  a	 page  break.  This  means that	if you
	  include '^L' printer directives or use  pascal  %S  compiler
	  directive, you will get more page breaks than	you may	want.

	  Each _i_n_d_e_x or	_f_i_l_e starts on an odd page to  allow  replace-
	  ment by more up-to-date versions of the file (use -0 to pro-
	  duce new indexes).

	  It is	possible to show _d_i_f_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s between file versions, in
	  which	 case  _d_e_l_e_t_e_d lines are shown in italics with a minus
	  sign in the extreme left-hand	margin,	and  _a_d_d_e_d  lines  are
	  shown	in bold	with a plus sign in the	extreme	left-hand mar-
	  gin. It is possible to highlight changes  with  _s_h_a_d_i_n_g,  if
	  the font supports it.

	  For ease of _l_o_c_a_t_i_n_g differences in the printout, the	 first
	  modified pages are shown on the _f_i_l_e _i_n_d_e_x in	brackets after
	  the start page for both files	and functions. For _f_i_l_e_s, glo-
	  bal  (i.e.  non-function)  changes are limited to before the
	  first	function and after the	last  function.	  Changes  in-
	  between  _f_u_n_c_t_i_o_n_s  are  tagged as applying to the following
	  function.  Omitted pages are shown explicitly	to avoid  con-
	  fusion.

	  By design, _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t will only produce printouts  using  the
	  AT&T	_U_N_I_S_O_N	print spooling system. This performs filtering
	  (i.e.	postprocessing using filters like postcpr, x9700  Etc)
	  and  scheduling  to  the specified printer.  _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t print
	  options all relate to	the _p_r_t	 command  options.   _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t
	  will work out	your print defaults from the $HOME/.prt	file.

	  If _U_N_I_S_O_N is not supported on	your  system,  then  _t_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t
	  will	_n_o_t  perform  any  printing  and will direct output to
	  standard output.  It is up to	the user to pipe the output to
	  a  print command (e.g. lpr).	The output will	already	be run
	  through a postprocessor however (e.g.	postcpr	or x9700),  as
	  this	provides  some	essentials  of	the printout, e.g. the
	  font,	point size, Etc. Some apparent print options (e.g. -1,
	  -2, -T) will therefore affect	the output produced.

	  Most of the above features can be  _e_x_c_l_u_d_e_d  if  you	prefer
	  using	the -x option.

	  _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t is under constant development, and any problems or
	  suggested enhancements will be welcomed.

			 required.  For	each file _t_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t will  then
			 attempt  to  run  diff(1) on the filename and

			 blank	lines.	 Note that all white space and
			 comments _a_f_t_e_r	real source code will be  left

			 as above and the original numerical counts of

	  In shell scripts, beware of using "echo" without  quotes  as
	  _t_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t will accept	"if .. then" or	"do" as	a new block.

	  The default "-xb" for	shell languages	is only	set if -tsh is
	  provided.   There is currently no way	to unset this, so omit
	  the -tsh if you want braces depth printed.

	  All the postscript postprocessors do not print in  10	 point
	  in  landscape	mode because they scale	the printout. Thus you
	  will get the correct number of lines but it will appear in a
	  smaller  font	 than for portrait. Because of this scaling it
	  is not possible for me to work out how many lines would make
	  the  printout	appear in 10 point since I cannot tell whether
	  they are using 10 point or not. Therefore landscape printing
	  will	have  the  same	number of lines	as portrait until this
	  can be solved.

	  Please be aware that CPP #if statements  and	ECMS  #feature
	  lines	 cause havoc with program printing because you may not
	  have correct C syntax. It is too much	to expect _t_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t to
	  be  able  to get rid of these	conditional comiplation	state-
	  ments. As _t_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t parses the syntax	of the code  in	 order
	  to  find  the	 end  of the function, it may get confused and
	  think	a '}' in the first column. This	causes problems	 miss-
	  ing  function	defintions and recognising statements as func-
	  tions	incorrectly.  _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t	attempts to solve this by sav-
	  ing  the  braces depth on #elif or #else statements and res-
	  toring it on the #endif so only one  part  of	 the  code  is
	  parsed.  Similarly  for  adjacent #if	or #feature statements
	  the #endif or	#endfeature statement saves the	 braces	 depth
	  which	 is  restored  at  the end of the next #if or #feature
	  statement.  It is not	recommended to use the 'cmspr'	option
	  with	 heavily  featured  files  or  the  've'  option  with
	  "whole=y" set.

	  Please note that the perl language is	context	 sensitive  on
	  certain  syntax and without a	symbol table, _T_r_u_e_p_r_i_n_t	cannot
	  make the correct decision on how to parse the	language.
