            tess is a shell script  that  calls  the  TRAINING  AND
            EDUCATION  SERVICES SYSTEM.  This System is used either
            to register for Global Public Networks Training  or  to
            help manage an Education Plan.  The tess system is menu
            driven and requires no options.

            This tool was created to connect Global Public  Network
            (GPN)  personnel directly to the tess system from their
            UNIX command line.

            This tool replaces the exptools,  edplan.   The  edplan
            functionality  remains  in tact, with the added ability
            of registration and course offering features.

            This tool should be available  on  all  general-purpose
            computers  used  in  the GPN.  No special environmental
            characteristics are required.

            Since the "tess"  command  accesses  the  Training  and
            Educational  Services  System, your machine should have
            either datakit or ethernet available. If none of  these
            networks  are  available  on  your machine, the command
            will display an error message and will  also  give  you
            further  information  on  how you can access the System
            directly from datakit destination or via  ethernet.  If
            both  the  networks  are available on your machine, the
            command will use the datakit network.

            Context sensitive help is available throughout the TESS
            System  by  entering  CONTROL-W  (Press  and  hold  the
            CONTROL Key and enter the letter  "W").  If  you  enter
            help  through any of the user menus or the introduction
            screen, you will have the option of displaying the help
            message  to your terminal or redirecting it to an email
            address or a printer. If you enter  help  in  an  input
            screen,  the  help  will  be displayed automatically to
            your terminal since the help messages are small.
