            _t_i_m_e_c_a_r_d_s is a program that allows interactive entry of
            weekly timecards that keeps the timecard information
            on-line in an nroff/troff format for easy printing.
            Typically, this entry function would be performed by a
            secretary.  This program also produces several reports
            and audits and provides some basic administrative
            features.

            _G_e_t_t_i_n_g _S_t_a_r_t_e_d

            Initially, a directory must be created where the
            timecard information will reside (by default, assumed
            to be $HOME/timecards) and the TIMECARDS shell variable
            must be set to this directory and exported.  Typically,
            this would be done as follows:

                        mkdir $HOME/timecards
                        TIMECARDS=$HOME/timecards
                        export TIMECARDS

            If the timecards reside in a directory other than
            $HOME/timecards, the TIMECARDS shell variable MUST be
            set and exported every time you login to use this
            program.  Normally, you should do this in your .profile
            so it gets set up automatically every time you login.

            You should also create a $TIMECARDS/valid_wpns file
            that is initialized to contain the standard work WPNs
            (work project numbers) used in your work area.  Every
            time a timecard is entered, the WPN that is entered is
            checked to see if it exists in this file unless it is a
            loading WPN (begins with a 9).  If the WPN is not in
            this valid_wpns file, you will be asked if it is a good
            WPN.  The WPNs in the valid_wpns file are listed one
            WPN per line such as 121150-0001.  You can use your
            favorite editor to create this file.

            Alternatively, you can use the TCWPNS shell variable to
            specify one or more files that contain valid WPNs, one
            per line.  For instance,

       timecards(1)             (EXPTOOLS)             timecards(1)


                  TCWPNS="/f2/auser/tcwpns $HOME/mywpns"
                  export TCWPNS

            in your .profile would direct timecards to check WPNs
            against the list in both the tcwpns and mywpns files.

            Once you have taken care of the preliminaries, you can
            invoke the program without any options which is the
            standard invocation for interactive mode.  The program
            has three simple menus - the main menu and the
            administrative and report sub-menus.  Initially, you
            are put in the main menu and prompted with your choices
            which are selected by a single character.  Here is the
            main menu:


                 Main menu - enter e, h, p, w, r, a, q, !, or ? (for help):


            If you type ???? in response, you will get this:


                 e - enter timecards
                 h - holiday entry
                 p - PAN to name
                 w - weekending
                 r - report menu
                 a - administrative menu
                 q - quit
                 ! - escape to UNIX command level
                 ? - help


            Much of this is self-explanatory but will be elaborated
            on a little later.  For now, you will want to type aaaa to
            get in the administrative menu so that you can add the
            names of the members of your work area to the database.
            When you do this, you will be prompted as follows:


                 Administrative menu -
                         enter a, s, b, m, d, e, p, t, l, n, q, !, or ? (for help):


            Typing ???? will give this explanation:

       timecards(1)             (EXPTOOLS)             timecards(1)


                 a - add employee to database
                 s - set standard work time for employee (if not 40 hours)
                 b - change boss (supervisor) for employee(s)
                 m - moved employee (another dept or gone)
                 d - delete employee
                 e - edit employee work and/or attendance file
                 p - put (ship/send) database or work/attendance information
                 t - take (receive) a database shipped (put) to you
                 l - list all employees
                 n - new year setup
                 q - quit
                 ! - UNIX command escape (e.g., !ksh to get to command level and
                       'exit' to get back to timecards)
                 ? - help


            Then you can type aaaa and you will be prompted for the
            necessary information for each employee to be added to
            the database.

            Once you are finished with the administrative menu, you
            will return to the main menu when you type qqqq.  Now you
            can type rrrr to get to the report menu which will give
            you this:


                 Report menu - enter a, m, c, t, o, s, b, f, v, q, !, or ? (for help):


            Typing ???? will give this explanation:


                 a - audit timecards
                 m - missing timecard check
                 c - WPN (case) charging by employee report
                 t - time charging summary report
                 o - overtime by employee report
                 s - standard weekly checks/reports (a+m+c+t+b)
                 b - backup creation
                 f - forms printout for work/attendance
                 v - vacation/PDO/NFH report
                 q - quit
                 ! - escape to UNIX command level
                 ? - help


            Typing qqqq will return you to the main menu and typing
            another qqqq will exit you from the main menu and out of
            the program entirely.

       timecards(1)             (EXPTOOLS)             timecards(1)


            The normal mode of operation will be to collect the
            weekly timecards and enter them one-by-one into the
            database.  To do this, you invoke the program which
            will put you in the main menu and type eeee to enter
            timecards.  Initially, you will be prompted to enter
            the week for which the timecard data is being entered
            in mm-dd format (two digit month and day but leading
            zeros can be ignored so 01 and 1 are equivalent).  The
            week is specified as a Sunday (e.g., 11-9 for 11/9/86).

            Next, you will be prompted for the definition of the
            standard time for a work week which defaults to a 40
            hour work week of 8 hours Monday through Friday.  In
            some cases, it will make entry of timecard data easier
            if the standard time is defined to be something else.
            For instance, if Monday were a holiday, then the
            standard time would be more logically defined as
            32;;8;8;8;8 or 32 hours of 8 hours Tuesday through
            Friday.

            After these preliminaries, you will be prompted for a
            payroll account number (PAN).  You can either enter the
            PAN or the person's last name (in upper or lower case).
            If you choose to enter the name, it must uniquely
            identify the person in your database.  If it doesn't,
            all of the people who have the same last name will be
            printed at your terminal with their PAN and you will be
            prompted again for a PAN which you will have to enter
            as a number.

            Once you have successfully entered a valid PAN (or
            name), you will be prompted to enter the time worked or
            not worked as follows:


                 Enter s, m, o, n, t, r, p, a, q, or ? (for help):


            Requesting help will give you:















       Page 4                                     (printed 2/18/91)








       timecards(1)             (EXPTOOLS)             timecards(1)


                 s = Single WPN, standard time
                 m = Multiple WPNs or multiple entries
                 o = Overtime
                 n = Standard time not worked
                 a = Add another timecard
                 q = Quit
                 t or t.tag = Tag timecard data for repeat
                 r or r.tag = Repeat timecard data
                 d or d.tag = Display repeat timecard data
                 p or p.tag = Preserve timecard data permanently for repeat


            When you enter time worked, you will be prompted for
            the WPN and the time charged.  In the special case
            where a person has worked a standard (e.g., 40 hour)
            work week charged to a single WPN, you can indicate
            that and you need only identify the WPN.  The program
            will automatically charge 40 hours to this WPN and show
            the hours as 8 hours for Monday through Friday.

            When the time charged is not the simple single WPN,
            standard hours or for overtime, you will be prompted
            for the WPN and hours and hours per day as:

                 WPN;time;m;t;w;t;f;s;s

            For instance, responding as 121150-0000;32;;8;8;8;8 is
            interpreted as 32 hours charged to 121150-0000 with no
            time charged on Monday and 8 hours charge for Tuesday
            through Friday.  Note that trailing, empty days can be
            left off if desired as was done for Saturday and Sunday
            in this example.

            If you request to enter time not worked (nnnn), you will
            be prompted as follows:


                 Enter vac, nfh, pdo, hol, sick, per, other, <cr>, or ? (for help):


            Requesting help will give you:













       Page 5                                     (printed 2/18/91)








       timecards(1)             (EXPTOOLS)             timecards(1)


                 vac = vacation
                 nfh = non fixed holiday
                 pdo = paid day off
                 hol = holiday
                 sick = sick time
                 per = personal time
                 other = other time
                 <carriage return> = continue


            When time not worked is entered, you will be prompted
            to enter the days of the week as one or more of the
            following:

                 mon tue wed thu fri sat sun

            In addition, for sick, personal, or other time, you
            will be prompted for whether the "time off" is being
            paid.

            If you inadvertently get into the standard, multiple,
            overtime, or not worked entry mode, you can get out by
            simply typing a carriage return.

            When timecard entry is completed for an individual, the
            next timecard entry is started by typing a aaaa.  Once you
            have entered all timecards, you quit by typing a qqqq
            instead of a PAN.  Then you will be prompted whether
            you want to check the timecards.  If you type yyyy, you
            will be put in the report menu where you can request
            various checks.  Typically, you will want to at least
            check to see if there are any missing timecards.  In
            addition, you will probably want to type tttt to find how
            many hours were charged for the week.  The t option
            will show the time charged per WPN including overtime.
            This is a very useful crosscheck to see that the
            correct total number of hours for the week was entered
            and that no unexpected work WPNs were entered
            inadvertently.  If any of this data looks suspicious,
            typing aaaa will run an audit that may well uncover some
            errors.  The audit will, for instance, identify any
            "invalid" WPNs and any employee whose standard time
            (worked plus non-worked) does not total up to 40 hours.

            In order to simplify timecard entry, a repeat (e.g.,
            memory) capability is provided.  This feature allows
            the timecard data entered for a person to be remembered
            and repeated for as many other people as desired.  This
            feature is invoked by requesting the tag (tttt) option



       Page 6                                     (printed 2/18/91)








       timecards(1)             (EXPTOOLS)             timecards(1)


            which will save all the timecard data entered after the
            tag option is requested and the save will stop with the
            next timecard.  This saved timecard data can then be
            repeated for any other person by requesting the repeat
            (rrrr) option.  This saved timecard data is erased upon
            exiting from the timecards program unless it is
            preserved indefinitely by exercising the pppp option.
            Preserved information is retained and available for
            future timecard entry.

            The repeat feature also allows the timecard data to be
            tagged with a name to allow multiple repeat "memories".
            By default, the repeat data has a "null" or empty tag.
            A repeat tag can be provided by specifying tttt...._t_a_g for
            the tttt option where _t_a_g is a string of alphanumerics
            with a maximum length of 5 characters (e.g., tttt....5555eeee5555).
            Similarly, this tagged data can be repeated or
            preserved by providing the same tag with the rrrr and pppp
            options (e.g., rrrr....5555eeee5555 and pppp....5555eeee5555).  This capability
            allows tagging to be used to simplify entry of
            timecards charged to the same WPN and time.  It also is
            useful for weeks where most or all of an entire
            department attends a common function such as an AA
            meeting.  In this case, the timecard entry can be
            tagged and made for a single person and repeated for as
            many others as necessary.

            Note that the repeat data is saved for both work and
            attendance information.  Also note that the use of tags
            allows multiple repeat memories that can be applied for
            any timecard entry in any order.  For additional
            convenience, the dddd option (or dddd.tag) displays the
            contents of a repeat memory.

            If you have an employee who is a part-time employee, be
            sure to use the ssss option of the administrative menu to
            set the standard work week hours.

            If an employee moves to another department or leaves
            the company, you should normally use the mmmm option of
            the administrative menu to change the employee's
            department number to his/her new department (or use
            00000 for someone who leaves the company).

            If an employee moves to your department from a
            department that has been using the timecards program,
            you will want to get a copy of that person's timecard
            information so that you have an up-to-date record of
            that person's absences (vacation, PDOs, etc.).  To do

            this, you will need to copy the person's previous
            department's work file to your work directory
            ($TIMECARDS/work) and the attendance file to your
            attendance directory ($TIMECARDS/attendance).  Then you
            will need to use the bbbb and mmmm options of the
            administrative menu to change the person's supervisor
            and department to those of the new department.

            Normally, the timecards program is used interactively.
            However, some of the reports are more useful if they
            are captured in a file which can be either printed or
            used as input for additional processing by other
            programs.  If the timecards program is entered with any
            option besides the -w, it is assumed the program is
            being run in batch mode and the menus are bypassed.
            The options you can specify in batch mode are:


            -w        The week is identified by specifying the
                      Sunday that ends the week in mm-dd-yy or mm-
                      dd format (e.g., 11-10 or 11-10-88) where mm
                      is the month, dd is the day, and yy is the
                      year.  Leading zeros may be suppressed (e.g.,
                      1-5 is equivalent to 01-05).


            -p        The payroll account number is specified as a
                      6 digit number (e.g., 012345) with leading
                      zeros as necessary.  This option is useful
                      with the -v (vacation) option to produce
                      vacation reports for all employees.  The -p
                      option defaults to all payroll account
                      numbers which is useful when timecards is
                      being used in a batch mode to produce a
                      report for everyone.


            -acwmtsbv These options are the same as those defined
                      for the menu selections (e.g., the -a is the
                      audit option of the report menu).


            -news     This option will print the latest news about
                      timecards changes and enhancements.
                      Normally, this news will only be printed the
                      first time a new version of the timecards
                      program is used.  Thereafter, the only way to
                      see this news again is with this option.

                week with a holiday is not a standard 40 hour work
                week so the single WPN option cannot be used.

            p   print the name associated with a payroll account
                number for which you will be prompted.

            w   set the week date.  This is useful if timecard
                information is going to be added to more than one
                week in a single session.

            r   enter the report menu.

            a   enter the administrative menu.

            !command escape out of timecards and execute the UNIX
                command.  Typing !date will execute the UNIX date
                command and return to timecards.  More useful is to
                type !/bin/sh which will escape out of timecards
                and put you back in the UNIX shell.  Now, all
                regular UNIX commands can be typed.  Typing exit
                will return you back to where you were in
                timecards.

            m   print any timecards missing for the week.

            w   print the time worked (including overtime) and WPNs
                charged by employees for the week along with the
                time not worked (e.g., sick).  The output is sorted
                by supervisory group and by name within the group.

                the week.

            b   create a backup file for the week's data in the
                $TIMECARDS/backup directory.  This is useful to
                provide additional protection against losing
                timecard information in the event of a system
                crash.  However, there is no automatic recovery
                procedure to use this data to restore the database;
                it must be done manually.

            f   print the work and/or attendance information for
                all employees in the database.  You must have
                read/write access to the work and attendance files
                to exercise this option.  You will be prompted to
                determine what to print.  Note that this option
                will take a few minutes to complete.  When it is
                finished, a Xerox 9700 print job will be scheduled
                as a batch job.  Alternatively, you can change the
                print destination by setting the TCPRINT shell
                variable to a command with any desired options and
                this command will be executed with all of the
                work/attendance files as arguments.  For instance,
                TCPRINT is set by default to:

                      TCPRINT="mmx -rN0 -t -ybell "

                to get the standard Xerox 9700 print job.

            v   print the time not worked.  You will be prompted
                for a PAN and will get a printout of the vacation,
                PDOs, NFHs, holidays, sick, personal, and other
                time not worked.

                for the supervisor's name and then all of the
                employees that should show that supervisor.  This
                is useful for reorganizations.

            m   mark employee as moved (another dept or gone).
                Alternatively, you can entirely remove an employee
                by removing his/her work and attendance files.
                However, if you do that you will lose the ability
                to include the time a moved employee charged while
                a member of your organization in any future
                generated reports.

                work or attendance file.  For each file, you will
                be put in your favorite editor as indicated by the
                EDITOR shell variable.  If the EDITOR variable is
                not specified, the regular UNIX ed editor will be
                used.

                manually editted where the vacation/PDO/NFH
                allowance changes for an employee.

            p   put (ship/send) either some of the timecard
                database files or weekly work/attendance
                information to another user.  You will be prompted
                for who to send the database/information to, for
                which PANs (all or a designated list), and for
                which weeks (all or a designated list).  This is
                sent (as a cpio file when a database is sent) to
                the specified user via uuto.

            This command could be run every week to append to a
            simple file to keep a record of the time charging week
            by week.  Other UNIX commands can then be used to graph

            This is a shell program that uses a number of shell
            features and has been tested under ksh.  Hopefully,
            this program will run with the regular shell as well
            but there are some subtle differences between the two
            so no guarantee is made other than for the ksh.  The
            chsh(1) command can be used to set ksh as your standard
            shell.
