          Sample macro file for "hybrowse -a"

Jump to an absolute location
%aj=@Help\^Named section\n

Where am I?  (Demo of shell variables)
%aw=!echo "Looking at $HYDOC section $HYSECT  (line $HYLINE)"\n

Continuation lines
%ac=!echo "This is the beginning \
and the end"\n

Edit the current source file:
 - assumes the source ends with ".mm"
 - assumes the source is in the directory with the formatted file
 - won't enter the editor unless the file exists and can be written
 - starts at the appropriate section header
 - vi and emacs know about the "+" argument; other editors might have
   problems with it.

%ae=!!test -w $HYDOCP.mm  &&  \
     ${EDITOR:-vi} "+/\^\\.H *[U1-9] *\\"*$HYSECT\\"* *$/" $HYDOCP.mm\n

A reserved macro - redefinition is ignored
%ah=!echo "Hello, world"\n

A macro with a control-character name
%a^H=!echo "Hello, world (version 2)"\n

Nested macros:
%ay=azaz
%az=!echo "I'm the az macro"\n

ap pretends to print the currently-displayed file.
(An example of a hidden definition - look at the appcmds file)

	WRITING (Test of -r interaction with macros)

%as=!lf\n
%ar=w ~/rje/temp.hy\n

%al=!echo "this is a test of a very long macro definition" ;echo "this is a test of a very long macro definition" ;echo "this is a test of a very long macro definition" ;echo "this is a test of a very long macro definition"\n


NOTES:

  - The macros work from any document; you don't have to be
    looking at the application-help section.

  - Good choices for macros might be editing, printing, and
    jumping to special documents (e.g., "an" for "News").

  - You can format your macro file with nroff, but it's
    easier to do it manually because of the escape sequences
    and the requirement that definitions start in column 1.


           REFERENCES

Hybrowse never prints reference pages, so the following won't
appear in the application-help displays.  However, it will be
processed during the scan for macro definitions.

%ap=!echo "pretending to: opr -pport $HYDOCP"\n
