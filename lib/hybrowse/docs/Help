^1^Help Overview
    Help is a regular hybrowse document.  You can use any hybrowse
    commands to find the help you need.  For example:

        _T_y_p_e    _I_f _y_o_u _w_a_n_t _t_o

        SPACE   move sequentially through the help screens
        t       display a list of Help section headings
        r       return to the document you were looking at before
        i       search the Help document for some term
        2       run the hybrowse tutorial (goes to reference [2])
        3       learn how to use menus (goes to reference [3])
        Q       exit from hybrowse

    The "2" and "3" commands must be followed by the RETURN key so
    that hybrowse will know when you are through typing digits.

^1^Basic Topics




































































































































^2^Document Model
    Hybrowse mimics the way you work with paper documents:

      1.  Each input file is called a "document".

      2.  Each document consists of one or more "sections", which can
          be nested.  Section headers are printed at the top of the
          screen.

      3.  Each document has a "Table of Contents" that lists its
          sections.  The Table of Contents is itself a section.

      4.  A "Catalog" describes all of the available documents.  The
          catalog is itself a document.

      5.  The hybrowse reference manual is also a document; it is
          named "Help".

      6.  Relationships between documents are implemented as
          "references".

      7.  "Bookmarks" can be set to make it easy to return to
          particular pages.

      8.  Bookmarks are automatically saved at the sections you
          recently examined.  This corresponds to keeping a temporary
          bookmark in the last few pages you looked at.

      9.  You can scan a section by using a search command.

     10.  You can find all occurances of a phrase within a document
          by using an "index".





































































































^2^Screen Layout
    From top to bottom, the hybrowse screen contains:

    _f_i_l_e        the name of the current file

    _h_e_a_d_i_n_g_s    section headings under which the text is nested

    _t_e_x_t        the body of the section

    _m_e_n_u        a list of available commands
                The menu line is blank until you press the TAB key.

    _m_e_s_s_a_g_e     either a page number, a prompt, or an error message

    _k_e_y-_h_e_l_p    a one-line summary of the most significant keys






















































































































^2^Prompt Modes
    Commands that are longer than a single character print a prompt
    on the message line and update the key-help line.

    Variable-length commands must be terminated by the RETURN key so
    hybrowse can tell when you are done typing.  Fixed-length
    commands do not require a RETURN.  The key-help line at the
    bottom of the screen tells you when RETURN is needed.

    Commands that have default values show it on the prompt line:

       - To use the default, just press RETURN.

       - To use a different value, type the value you want.
         The default will disappear when you start typing.

       - To cancel the prompt, press the ESCAPE key.




















































































































^2^Menu Mode
    Most hybrowse commands are accessible from a menu.  Enter menu
    mode by pressing the TAB key.  Then watch the bottom three lines
    on the screen.

    In menu mode:

    _T_y_p_e      _I_f _y_o_u _w_a_n_t _t_o

    ?         get help on menu-mode commands

    SPACE     move the highlight
              The description will describe the highlighted item:
                 - submenu descriptions end with "..."
                 - command descriptions usually end with key=command

    RETURN    execute the highlighted item

    DELETE    cancel menu mode without executing any menu item


















































































































^2^Mouse Interface
    Hybrowse supports the mouse on terminals running viterm or
    emacsterm [1].  An identical interface is available on SUN
    workstations running etermx [2].

    Mouse button 2 displays a menu of hybrowse commands.
    Button 1 is sensitive to the location where you click it:

              _R_e_g_i_o_n                       _M_e_a_n_i_n_g

        File name (line 1)   Go to Table of Contents
        Section heading      Go to the section
        Left column          Horizontal scroll - show left
        Right column         Horizontal scroll - show right
        Text region          Go to nearest reference on the line
        Scrollbar            Scroll within section
        Key-help line        Simulate pressing the key
        Menu                 Select and run item



















































































































                               _R_E_F_E_R_E_N_C_E_S



     1. Viterm and emacsterm are exptools that run on 630, 730,
        5620, and related terminals.  To download them, call
        them without parameters in a layers window.

     2. etermx is an exptool that runs under X-Windows.  It
        emulates emacsterm.


























































































































^1^Moving within a section




































































































































^2^Horizontal Scrolling
    The hybrowse truncates long lines; if you want to see the end of
    a long line, you have to explicitly ask for it.

    The command ">" shifts the display so you can see more text
    toward the end of the lines.

    The command "<" shifts the display so you can see more text
    toward the beginning of the lines.

    Horizontal scrolling is automatically canceled when you move to a
    different document or section.

























































































































^2^Beginning of section
    Jump to the beginning of the current section:

    vi      g

    emacs   M-<































































































































^2^End of section
    Jump to the end of the current section:

    vi      G

    emacs   M->































































































































^2^Page forward
    The space bar prints the next screen of text from the current
    section.

    If entered at the end of a section, it goes to the beginning of
    the next section.

    Editor-specific equivalents also work:

    vi      ^F or f

    emacs   ^V  or v

























































































































^2^Page backward
    The BACKSPACE key (^H) prints the previous screen of text from
    the current section.

    If entered at the beginning of a section, it goes to the
    BEGINNING of the preceding section.

    Editor-specific equivalents also work:

    vi      ^B or b

    emacs   M-v

























































































































^2^Half page forward
    Scroll the screen to show the next half page of text:

    vi      ^D or d

    emacs   M-^N or M-n

    This command never moves into the next section.





























































































































^2^Half page backward
    Scroll the screen to show the preceding half page of text:

    vi      ^U or u

    emacs   M-^P or M-p

    This command never moves into the preceding section.





























































































































^2^Line forward
    Scroll the screen to show the next line of text:

    vi      ^E or e or j

    emacs   ^N or n

    The RETURN key (^J) works for both editors.

    This command never moves to other sections.



























































































































^2^Line backward
    Scroll the screen to show the preceding line of text:

    vi      ^Y or y or k

    emacs   ^P or p

    This command never moves to other sections.





























































































































^1^Moving between sections




































































































































^2^Table of contents
    Every document begins with a section called "Table of Contents".
    It can be displayed by pressing the "t" key from anywhere within
    the document.  It is like any other section: you can scroll,
    search, return, etc.  Every line contains a reference, so you can
    jump directly to any section.

    If the "r" command will return you to a section in the same
    document, that section is marked with "r->".  This makes the "t"
    command handy for getting an overview of where you are in the
    document.

    The -g flag on the hybrowse command line determines which
    sections are shown in the Table of Contents:

       - If -g is not used, all section headers are shown.

       - If -g is used, only the highest-level headers are shown.
         Selecting a high-level section  jumps to a list of its
         subsections.  This makes the interface look more like a menu
         than a Table of Contents.
















































































































^2^Named section
    The "@" command prompts for document and section names and goes
    to the specified location.

    Your response to the prompt should be "document^section".

         document defaults to the current document
         section defaults to the first section in the document

    You don't need to type the "^" if you are defaulting the section
    name.

    If either the document or section doesn't exist, no move will
    take place.  The specified names must match exactly, including
    use of case and whitespace.

    For compatibility with vi and emacs, the commands ":r" and "^X^F"
    are equivalant to "@".



















































































































^2^Next section
    The "]" command goes to the next section, skipping past any
    remaining pages in the current section.

    It will fail if you are at the end of the document.
































































































































^2^Previous section
    The "[" goes to the beginning of the previous section, skipping
    past any preceding pages in the current section and skipping all
    but the first page of the preceding section.

    It will fail if you are at the beginning of the document (which
    is always the Table of Contents).






























































































































^2^Parent section
    The "^" command goes to the parent section.

    The name of the parent section is always the second-from-bottom
    line in hybrowse's display of section headings at the top of the
    screen.

    It will fail if you are already at a top-level heading.

    Table of Contents for example:

         Animals
           Mammals
           Fish
         Plants

    The ^ command would jump from "Fish" to "Animals", skipping over
    "Mammals".



















































































































^2^Forward past subsections
    The "}" commands skips past all subsections of the current
    section.  It's handy for moving quickly through the first-level
    headings of a document without looking at lower-level details.

    It will fail if there are no following sections at the same or
    higher nesting level.

    Table of Contents for example:

         Animals
           Mammals
           Fish
         Plants

    The } command would jump from "Animals" to "Plants", skipping
    over the subsections of "Animals".




















































































































^2^Backward past subsections
    The "{" command skips backward to the preceding section with a
    section nesting level equal to or less than the current section's
    level.

    It will fail if there is no such section.

    Table of Contents for example:

         Animals
           Mammals
           Fish
         Plants

    The { command would jump from "Plants" to "Animals", skipping
    over the subsections of "Animals".





















































































































^1^Jumping via Links




































































































































^2^References
    References are symbolic links to other sections or other
    documents.  They appear in the document's text as "[n]", where
    "n" is a number.

    You can go to a referenced document/section by typing its number
    followed by a carriage return.

    You can use the "r" command  [1] to return to the text that
    contained the reference.

    Some documents contain references to paper documents.  If you try
    to jump to those references hybrowse will display the reference
    (typically information on how to order the paper document) and
    then return you to your original location.  Here's an example
     [2].

    Some references execute hybrowse macros instead of jumping to
    another section.  The text around the reference should warn you
    when this will happen.  See reference  [3] for details on
    defining executable references.
















































































































                               _R_E_F_E_R_E_N_C_E_S



     1. ^Return

     2. This is a sample reference that will pop up when you
        select it.  It would normally give information about
        ordering a paper copy of the referenced document.

     3.     Admin^Active References

























































































































^2^Return
    Each time you jump a non-trivial distance, hybrowse records your
    starting location so you can return by typing "r".  Local moves,
    such as "next section" or "previous section" do not save the
    starting location, so you cannot return from them.

    The return addresses are kept on a stack, so you can press "r"
    repeatedly to undo a series of jumps.  There is no danger of the
    return stack overflowing, so don't feel obligated to return from
    every jump.



























































































































^1^Bookmarks
    The "m" command creates a "bookmark" at the current location.  It
    prompts for a single (lower-case alphabetic) character to name
    the mark.

    The "'" (apostrophe) command prompts for a bookmark name and then
    jumps to the mark.  Going to a mark pushes the current location
    on the return stack so you can return via the "r" command.





























































































































^1^Exchange with stack
    The exchange command goes to the location on the top of the
    return stack and then pushes the location you started from onto
    the stack.  It's intended for flipping rapidly between two
    locations, such as when you want to compare two documents.

    The vi form of the command is invoked by typing "''" (two
    consecutive apostrophes).  The emacs form is invoked as "^X^X".

    A typical sequence for using this command is:

      1.  set a mark at the first location (mx)

      2.  go to the second location (using any hybrowse commands)

      3.  jump to the first location, saving the second on the stack
          ('x)

      4.  flip between the locations as often as necessary ('')


















































































































^1^Search and Index




































































































































^2^Search
    The "/" command searches for a string in the current section.
    The search starts at the second line on the screen and wraps from
    the last line in the section to the top of the section.  The
    matched line is moved to the top line of the screen

    The search command does not support regular expressions, but some
    characters in the search string are treated specially:

       - lower case letters matches either lower or upper case
       - matching works as expected on bold and underlined text
       - blanks and tabs match any sequence of white space, including
         newlines

    This command does not search the entire document; use the index
    command  [1] for whole-document searches.

    For emacs users, hybrowse also accepts: s and ^Xs.  They all do
    the same thing as "/".  Hybrowse doesn't read ^S characters, so
    if you accidentally type ^S for a search you may have to type ^Q
    to unlock your terminal.
















































































































                               _R_E_F_E_R_E_N_C_E_S



     1. ^Index Document































































































































^2^Repeat search
    This command repeats the previous search.  It's equivalent to
    pressing "/" and immediately pressing RETURN.

    If your editor is vi, the command name is "n".

    If your editor is emacs, the command name is "S".






























































































































^2^Index Document
    The "i" command:

       - prompts for a string
       - finds all occurrences of the string in the current document
       - creates an index with references to the matching lines
       - displays the index document

    This is the closest hybrowse comes to a global search command.

    If you invoke the "i" command multiple times, it will append the
    new results to the existing index.  The "I" command displays an
    existing index without doing another search.

    The index document is created in the /usr/tmp directory and will
    be removed when you leave hybrowse.





















































































































^2^Go to Index
    The "I" command goes to the index document created by "i"
    commands earlier in the same browsing session.


































































































































^1^Miscellaneous Commands




































































































































^2^Refresh screen
    The "^L" command is used to redraw the screen if it becomes
    garbled.


































































































































^2^Quit
    The q or Q command is used to exit from hybrowse.

    Editor-specific commands are also recognized:

    vi      :q or ZZ

    emacs   ^X^C

    To reduce the chance of accidental quits, some hybrowse
    applications don't accept lower-case "q".  In those applications,
    the "q" command will print a message telling you to use capital
    "Q" to exit.
























































































































^2^Escape to shell
    The "!" command prompts for a line to be executed by the shell.
    The default command line is the shell itself, so an interactive
    shell can be obtained by just pressing RETURN at the prompt.

    If the SHELL environment variable is set and exported, it is used
    to execute the specified command.

    Hybrowse also sets some environment variables:

         HYDOCP      the path to the current document
         HYDOC       the name of the current document
         HYSECT      the name of the current section
         HYLINE      the line number within the section

    The command can use these variables, for example, to put you into
    your editor at the corresponding spot in the document's source
    file.  The administrators' guide shows some examples  [1].

    If the first character of the escaped command is another "!", the
    prompt to "Press any key to continue" is skipped.  The "!!"
    command is generally used only in application macros [2].

    Hybrowse keeps multiple documents in memory, so if you change a
    document during a shell escape hybrowse won't show the changes.
    If you want the changes to show up in hybrowse, use the -u
    flag [3].










































































































                               _R_E_F_E_R_E_N_C_E_S



     1. Admin^Escape Scripts

     2. ^Application Commands

     3. Admin^Unbuffered Documents



























































































































^2^Write Section
    The "w" command appends the currently-displayed section to a
    file.

    See the "W" command (documented in the next section) for details.
































































































































^2^Write Subsections
    The "W" command appends the currently-displayed section _a_n_d _i_t_s
    _s_u_b_s_e_c_t_i_o_n_s to a file.  It prompts for a file name, which
    defaults to the last file written.  The filename can contain
    shell metacharacters.  A "file name" beginning with "!" or "|" is
    treated as pipeline; it is executed by /bin/sh and the output is
    piped to it.

    All sections of a document are treated as subsections of the
    Table of Contents, so an entire document can be written using "W"
    from the Table of Contents.

    The output won't exactly match the input:

       - the output will include the file name (surrounded with
         dashes to make it stand out)
       - multiple consecutive blank lines will have been compressed
       - the Reference Page will not be written

    Backspaces generated by nroff (e.g., for underlining or bold)
    will be included in the output.

    Some hybrowse applications (especially those on public logins)
    may prohibit users from writing to files.













































































































^2^Application Commands
    The "-a" flag on the hybrowse command allows application-specific
    macros to be defined.  These macros typically do things like
    sending documents to a printer, but they may contain any hybrowse
    commands.

    Application-specific commands are invoked by typing the letter
    "a" followed by a single character which indicates which macro to
    run.  No carriage return is needed.

    You can determine which (if any) application-specific commands
    are available in your application by typing "a?".

























































































































^1^Standard Documents




































































































































^2^Catalog
    The Catalog corrsponds to a library's card catalog; it is a
    document that references all other documents.  It's the starting
    point for accessing documents.

    Catalog is just a document: you can scroll, use references,
    return, etc.

    Catalog can be reached via the "c" command.




























































































































^2^Help
    The "?" or "h" command moves you to a document that describes the
    hybrowse commands.

    Help is just a document, so you can use all the standard hybrowse
    commands to study the documentation.

    (You are currently reading the Help document.)
