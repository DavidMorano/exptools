    If you want a tutorial on how to use hybrowse, press the space
    bar.  The tutorial takes about 10 minutes.

    Reference  [1] lists changes in this version of hybrowse.
    The biggest changes: menus [2], and a mouse interface [3].































































































































                               _R_E_F_E_R_E_N_C_E_S

     2. Help^Menu Mode

     3. Help^Mouse Interface



























































































































^1^Basic Commands
    The most important hybrowse commands are:

                     _K_e_y         _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n

                     SPACE       next page
                     BACKSPACE   previous page
                     ESCAPE      cancel prompt
                     ^L          redraw the screen
                     Q           quit from hybrowse

    You will use these commands to view the rest of the tutorial.
    After you read each screen, press the space bar to continue to
    the next screen.























































































































^1^Document Model
    Hybrowse is often used to read online documents, so it uses this
    conceptual model:

       - Each file is considered to be a "document".

       - Each document consists of a sequence of nested "sections".

       - Each document has a "Table of Contents" that lists the
         section headings.

       - Points where you may want to refer to other sections or
         documents are marked with "references".

       - A card "catalog" is a document that lists all the other
         documents.

    The commands will make the most sense if you keep the conceptual
    model in mind.


















































































































^1^Screen Layout
    The hybrowse screen contains:

    _L_i_n_e(_s)          _C_o_n_t_e_n_t

    1                Document filename
    2...n            Section headers (the number depends on nesting)
    central area     Text of the section
    2 above bottom   Menus (blank until the TAB key is pressed)
    1 above bottom   Prompts and messages
    bottom           Key summary


























































































































^1^Editor-Specific Commands
    The space bar is the simplest way to move sequentially through a
    document, but hybrowse also accepts commands based on your
    editor:

                        _F_u_n_c_t_i_o_n           _V_I     _E_M_A_C_S

                  Page forward           f          v
                  Page backward          b        M-v
                  Half page forward      d        M-n
                  Half page backward     u        M-p
                  Line forward           e or j     n
                  Line backward          y or k     p
                  Beginning of section   g        M-<
                  End of section         G        M->

    The notation "M-x" means the ESCAPE key followed by the "x" key.




















































































































^1^Searching
    The "/" key is used to search a section (not a whole document)
    for a string.  The search starts after the first line on the
    screen and wraps around to the beginning of the section if no
    match is found.  The matching line is moved to the top of the
    screen.

    Some characters in search strings are treated specially:

       - Lower case letters match either lower or upper case.
       - Blanks and tabs match any sequence of white space.
       - Bold and underlined text match as if they were regular text.

    Try some searches now.  After the first search, note how the
    default search string is displayed - if you prefer a different
    value, just ignore the default and it will go away when you start
    typing.




















































































































^1^References
    References are the primary way of moving through documents.  They
    print as "[n]" where "n" is a number.  To use a reference:

       - type the reference number
       - press the RETURN key after the last digit
       - hybrowse will display the referenced section
       - continue browsing in the referenced section

    Unlike most hybrowse commands, this one requires a RETURN key.
    That's because hybrowse has no other way to tell when you have
    typed the final digit.  (E.g., typing "2" could mean you want
    reference 2 or it could mean that you are starting to type "25".)


                                 _E_X_A_M_P_L_E

    The "r" command  [1] is often used after reading references.

    Try the reference in the preceding sentence:
         Type the digit "1" and press the RETURN key.
















































































































                               _R_E_F_E_R_E_N_C_E_S



     1. ^Return Command































































































































^1^The Table of Contents
    Every document has a section called the _T_a_b_l_e _o_f _C_o_n_t_e_n_t_s.  You
    can display it by pressing the "t" key.

    Each line of the Table of Contents contains a reference, so you
    can jump to any section by typing its reference number.  The
    Table of Contents is just a section of the document, so you can
    use the usual commands to scroll, search, return, etc.

    Try it:

       - Go to the Table of Contents
       - Follow the reference from there to the section called "Jump
         from TOC"
       - Return here to continue the tutorial

    The Table of Contents normally shows all section headers and
    their nesting.  However, some programs call hybrowse with a
    command-line argument that forces it to show only the top-level
    headers.  In that case, selecting a header shows the next-level
    headers.  That means you have to select more numbers to get to
    the text but you won't have to scroll through a long Table of
    Contents.  The overall effect is to make the Table of Contents
    look like nested menus.













































































































^1^The Catalog Document
    The "Catalog" is like the card catalog in a library - it lists
    all the available documents.  It works just like other documents:
    you follow references from it to the document you want to see.

    You will probably start your future browsing sessions by pressing
    the "c" key to display the Catalog; it gets you out of the
    tutorial and into the interesting documents.

    You can try "c" now if you want, but return here (with the "r"
    command) to finish the tutorial.


























































































































^1^The Help Document
    "Help" is a document that describes the hybrowse commands.  You
    can use all the regular commands to browse through it - it even
    has a Table of Contents.

    The Help document can be reached by pressing either the "?" or
    "h" key.

    Try it and then return here to continue the tutorial.




























































































































^1^The Menu
    The menu allows you to run commands without looking them up in
    Help.  You can access the menu by pressing the tab key.

    Try it - press the tab key.  Notice the changes on all three
    lines at the bottom of the screen.

    Press the space bar; notice that the description line changes to
    describe the highlighted item.

    Press the "?" key while the menus are displayed; it will pop up a
    short help message.

























































































































^1^Application-Specific Macros
    Some hybrowse applications define additional commands.  The
    application-specific command names always consist of "a" followed
    by one other character.

    Most applications use the default hybrowse Help document, so the
    "a" commands will not show up when you press "?".  An alternative
    command, "a?" displays help specifically for the "a" commands.





























































































































^1^Advanced Commands
    You now know the most important commands.  Additional commands
    that you may eventually want to learn are:

     [1]  Using a mouse
     [2]  Creating an index by searching a whole document
     [3]  Horizontal scrolling to read long lines
     [4]  Setting bookmarks so you can easily return to a page
     [5]  Writing a section to a file
     [6]  Escaping to the shell

    You can follow these references or look up the details in Help
    when you need them.

    You can continue by typing:

       c   to start browsing

       ?   to learn more commands

       a?  to learn about application-specific commands
           (There might not be any, but it won't hurt to check.)

       TAB to become familiar with the menu options

    If you want to format documents for hybrowse, read the Hybrowse
    Administrators' Guide  [1].





















































































































                               _R_E_F_E_R_E_N_C_E_S



     1. Admin^Table of Contents































































































































^1^The End
    You're past the end of the tutorial.

    Press BACKSPACE for directions.

































































































































^1^Return Command
    Each time you jump between documents or sections, hybrowse
    records your previous location.  You can then return to the
    previous location by pressing the "r" key.

    To return more than one level, just press "r" again.

    The "r" key can be used to:

       - return from a reference to the main document
       - get out of a HELP screen or Table of Contents
       - recover from an accidental keypress

    Press the "r" key now to continue with the section that got you
    here.






















































































































^1^Jump from TOC
    As you can see from the header line (the second line on the
    screen), this is the "Jump from TOC" section.

    Now press the "r" key _T_W_I_C_E to continue with the tutorial.
































































































































^1^Hybrowse Versions
    Both vi and emacs versions of most commands are now accepted.
    Your EDITOR enviroment variable affects the key bindings only for
    the few commands that would otherwise conflict.  This change
    makes the user interface more consistent in case you call
    hybrowse from someone else's login.

    Hybrowse now avoids turning off highlighting between words if the
    same highlighting will be turned back on for the next word.  This
    avoids the choppy effect that otherwise occurs on terminals that
    represent bold as reverse video.

    Some other recent changes to hybrowse are:

     [1]  A line at the bottom of the screen now shows the major
          command keys.

     [2]  A menu is now available.  Access it by pressing TAB.

     [3]  You can enter commands via the mouse if you have downloaded
          viterm/emacsterm/etermx into your terminal.

     [4]  Instead of listing all sections in the Table of Contents,
          you can now distribute the headings throughout the
          document.  This makes it easier to browse large documents.
