cms.el contains GNU Emacs aids for CMS/5ESS editing, 
by Paul Guthrie,IH6H315 x.2014  {ihlpj|ihdev}!pdg

 Additional features
   1.  Saving a featured file auto-extracts it
   2.  .L, .G suffixes are recognized as C format
 Key settings as follows
   ^C^F : insert featuring on next line - with arg, features out
   ^X^G : find file using vpath as follows
             in form "filename" looks in current, then down viewpath
                                relative to $ROOT
             in form "module/filename" looks down viewpath using $SS
             in form "ss/module/filename" looks down viewpath
          N.B. the node (or "ROOT") is updated in the status line
          so you can see where it was found.
   ^Cm  : run modbuild command, output in seperate buffer
          N.B. this does *not* run it in a queue
          use in conjunction with next-error (^X`) to fix syntax
   ^C^E : Extract the file in the named buffer
; Add .G and .L suffixes to auto-mode-alist, bound to c mode.

;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; This is the command to put in your .emacs file to cause cms to
;;; be loaded each time you start emacs. You can have it autoloaded
;;; when it is invoked, but it is easier to just load it every time.
;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------
(load-file "cms")   ;;; lazy way to set up cms in .emacs 

;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; If you want to autoload it, you have to bind the keys in your .emacs
;;; file, and put in an autoload statement for each top level function
;;; as follows. I guess you might as well use these since I went to the
;;; trouble of typing them in anyway. :-)
