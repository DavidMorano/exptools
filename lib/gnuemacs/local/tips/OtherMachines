Subject: How to get us to install GNU Emacs on your favorite exptool machine

Since gnuemacs is an "optional" exptool, you won't necessarily find it
on all exptools machines.  The current method to try to get it
installed on your exptools machine is to send your requests to Chip
Webb (Charles_A_Webb@ATT.COM).  If he doesn't give you a timely
response, try sending to the other current exptools gnuemacs
providers, who can be listed out with this exptools command:

			  providers gnuemacs

One way or other, we will try to get GNU Emacs up and running for you.
