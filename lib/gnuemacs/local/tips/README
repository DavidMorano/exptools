Subject: README.... about this -- the "tips" directory.
From: Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM
Date: 2/1991

Welcome to the exptools gnuemacs "tips" directory, where we place odds
and ends about gnuemacs.  We place them here for ease of our
maintenance (so we don't have to mess with the man page, etc.)  To get
a brief summary of of the files here try this shell command:

$ head -4 *

or

$ head -4 *[!Z]

to avoid compressed files (if there are any).

If you see any header saying "REQUIRED READING", you are required to
read that section.

If you are reading this on a machine that doesn't get exptools updates
too often, this tips directory might not have the latest news.  You
might want to check a machine available to you that has a fresh tips
directory.  As of 2/1991, the cbnews machines are one such place.
