Subject: Your friendly gnuemacs providers: who are we, and what are
	our e-mail addresses?
Date: 12/1991

Introducing Scott Thompson (sft@ihlpa.ATT.COM), Naperville, IL,
devoted laborer and main distributor for gnuemacs as an exptool.
The man with the master-plan (Makefile, actually) in his hand.

Introducing Chip Webb (Charles_A_Webb@ATT.COM), Holmdel, NJ.  Chip
helps organize gnuemacs distribution and he rewrote several sections
of the emacs initialization code to provide an AT&T exptools specific
message, and can help debug simple elisp problems.  However, don't
send him huge chunks of lisp code to debug.  He is the person to
contact if you want the source code for gnuemacs, or source code for
the manuals.  He is the mastermind of the exptools gnuemacs sun3 and
sun4 distributions.

Also we should mention people who have said that they can provide help
for gnuemacs, but not be full exptool providers: Bill Carpenter
(William_J_Carpenter@ATT.COM), Andy Sherman (Andrew_B_Sherman@ATT.COM).

12/1991: Dan Jacobson has retired from being a gnuemacs provider.  He may
possibly be on a leave of absence when you read this.  The nifty
cross-out pattern above was created using gnuemacs' picture-mode.
