The current exptools distribution of gnuemacs is setup with the
following directory structure (if installed in non-exptools context
much of the following article still applies):

 ~exptools = $TOOLS
       \
        \__bin
        |__lib___
                 \__gnuemacs
                          \__bin
                          |__dist__
                          |        \__etc
                          |        |__info
                          |        |__lisp__
                          |                 \__term
                          |__local_
                                   \__etc
                                   |__lisp__
                                   |        \__term
                                   |__tips


  Directories discussed in the following text exist under the exptools
login, the $TOOLS environment variable is expected to contain this
value, therefore directories will be specified relative to this login,
unless otherwise noted.

  The following will describe the use and contents of each directory.
First, under bin is a shell script that tests for and sets several
needed environment variables; after which it execs gnuemacs from
lib/gnuemacs/bin.

  The other two directories under lib/gnuemacs are dist and local;
dist contains directories comprising the standard distribution of
gnuemacs, with local containing directories making local additions
and/or modifications to the standard distribution of gnuemacs.  The
directories etc, lisp, and lisp/term exist for both the dist and local
directories and have the same purpose respectively.  Etc, contains
executables to support emacs, and ascii files documenting the
distribution.  Lisp, contains emacs lisp files used to form and
customize emacs's commands language, lisp/term contains terminal
specific files.  Finally, the dist/info directory contains files used
by the online documentation facility, and local/tips contains
suggestions and answers to commonly asked questions.

enjoy.

-------
Some places to look for our customized settings: in the lisp tree's files:
startup.el, site-init.el, default.el, also the "front end" script
$TOOLS/bin/gnuemacs.

Though most exptool providers post notices of minor changes via the
"toolnews" command, we will probably use the netnews group att.emacs
for this purpose.  Frequent toolnewses seen at login by those with
"toolnews" in their .profile, etc. files would be too disturbing.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% POSTING/SAVING NETNEWS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Exptools gnuemacs has facilities for posting/saving netnews---useful
if you are on a machine that carries netnews... see below.

AT&T EMPLOYEES REMEMBER: 1) ***SEE THE NEWSGROUP ATT.NEWS.POLICY FOR
CURRENT POSTING/SAVING RULES***. 2) A minor point that these rules
will remind you of is that crosspostings to both inernal and external
(to AT&T) newsgroups at the same time will fail, so don't try. 3)
Don't put any spaces between newsgroups on the "Newsgroups:" header:
e.g.,
Newsgroups: xxx.xx.xx,yy.yyyy.yy
not
Newsgroups: xxx.xx.xx, yy.yyyy.yy

4) If you break the rules in newsgroup att.news.policy, and especially
if it gets blamed on gnuemacs not warning you enough about the rules,
you will cause we the providers endless trouble and embarassment
having to hack up gnuemacs netnews posting/saving commands more and
more to warn you more and more.

5) if you can't find the rules in att.news.policy, write us.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  CBNEWS, SOURCES: CBNEWS is not for SOURCES!!!! 

[Dan Jacobson, 9/1990:] The un-byte-compiled GNU Emacs Lisp files
(.el's) are not distributed with exptools gnuemacs, in an effort to
save disk space.  At present the GNU Emacs version on the cbnews
machines carries the .el's.  This is a temporary solution, as the
cbnews machines are not meant for software distribution.  As of 9/1990
cbnews machines do not carry exptools.  Do "man gnuemacs" there to
find the location of the gnuemacs file tree and tips directory etc.
there.

As of 10/1990, the cbnews machines are the main place where you will
be able to sucessfully run the GNUS newsreader.

***PLEASE SEE THE TIPS DIRECTORY ON CBNEWS (do "man gnuemacs" first)
BEFORE DOING ANYTHING THERE.  And note especially ==> always e-mail to
we the providers for any sources, copying from cbnews machines causes
network constipation, and will result in us getting the ".el"'s kicked
off cbnews!

* To get a nice cpio of our package, including .el's, e-mail to
* Charles_A_Webb@ATT.COM, or sft@ihlpa.att.com.  They can also provide
* the C source too.
* 
* If you decide to pftp to prep.ai.mit.edu to get it from where we get
* it, you will 1) not get our goodie enhancements. 2) probably fill up
* disks (even /usr/tmp perhaps) and get everybody angry at you if you do
* it thru a cbnews machine.  Plus you will cause uucp constipation
* probably.

                Answers to Frequently Asked Questions
	       About the GNU Emacs Lisp Code Directory

                     Last Update: October 12, 1990


Q. What *is* the Lisp Code Directory?
A. Originally it was simply a list, in tabular form, of various
packages of GNU Emacs Lisp code that had been posted to one of the
Emacs-related Internet or USENET mailing lists or newsgroups.  Later
it became a flat-file database and associated formatting software.
Today it includes over 500 entries, contains entries for the packages
in the standard GNU Emacs distribution, and there is an elisp package
available for use with interfacing with it.

Q. Where can I get a copy of the Directory?
A. The latest copy can be ftp'd from tut.cis.ohio-state.edu.  The file
is pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/LCD-datafile.Z.  (The .Z means it's
compressed; use `binary' mode in ftp when retrieving it.)

Q. How can I get a copy of a package listed in the Directory?
A. The `archive' field of the LCD entry for the package indicates
where it's archived.  If this field starts with a `~', as in
~/lispdir.el.Z, the archive host is tut.cis.ohio-state.edu, and the
file is under the Emacs Lisp Archives which reside in the directory
pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive (see README.Z for more details).  If the
`archive' field is empty, the `contact' field indicates where one can
write by e-mail to obtain the code.  In the case of a package that's
part of the standard Emacs distribution, you probably already have it
in your $EMACS/lisp directory.  If you're  unable to find a copy
through the listed contact, post a query to gnu.emacs, info-gnu-emacs,
or your favorite Emacs group.

Q. What and where is the LCD interfacing package?
A. It's called `lispdir', and it's in ~/lispdir.el.Z.  (See previous
answer for details on exactly where that is.)  It currently produces a
full-directory report in three different formats, two of which are
tabular.  It also provides a function called lisp-dir-apropos that
pops up a buffer containing entries that relate to a given topic.

Q. I don't have ftp or uucp access.  Is there a mail archive server?
A. No, there isn't.  Probably the best thing for you to do is contact
the author directly.  If that fails, request the items you want via
your favorite Emacs mailing list or newsgroup.

Q. How can I get my package added to the Directory or get typos or
inaccuracies fixed?
A. Dave Brennan, brennan@dg-rtp.dg.com, maintains the Directory.  Send
typos and inaccuracies to him.  Dave Sill, de5@ornl.gov, maintains the
Emacs Lisp Archives.  Send submissions to him, and include an LCD
record.  See ~/guidelines.Z for more information on submissions.

NNTP to CBNEWSland:

WJC of Holmdel NJ says: "Of course, the big win comes when NNTP is
finally offered for real.  It is an absolutely stunning difference to
run the GNUemacs on another machine and have NNTP on the news servers.
The NNTP process must be really cheap.  As I recall, in the past I've
run long sessions and then done a "ps" on cbnews[censored ;-)] to see
the impact.  I think the NNTP process only got up to a few seconds
after a couple hours of news reading (but I'm quoting from memory)."

WJC's right... it's zooming!  Maybe one day we can all officially
connect there via NNTP...

Subject: GNUS: cbnews: /usr/add-on/server/bin/gnuemacs vs. exptools version
Reply-to: Dan_Jacobson@ihlpz.ATT.COM
Date: Fri 30 Aug 1991

Some of you have written to me mentioning that gnuemacs' GNUS netnews
reading program has seemingly broken itself suddenly on the cbnews
machines.  What has happened is that code you wrote in your .profile
has detected the newly added exptools login on cbnews, and put
 ~exptools/bin in front of /usr/add-on/server/bin (set in /etc/profile
--- the default) on your $PATH, causing you not to invoke our
custom-built cbnews gnuemacs-GNUS set-up in
/usr/add-on/server/bin/gnuemacs.

Yes, it would be nice to merge the two.  I am trying to obtain official
support for gnuemacs and our other free software tools for Bell Labs.
That way we could give more timely updates to you the users.  If you
believe these tools are important and you might be able to help us
find funding, please contact me.
