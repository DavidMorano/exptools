Though the cbnews machines don't carry exptools (as of 1/1991) they do
carry our gnuemacs.  You might want to try GNU Emacs' GNUS newsreader
there.  Make sure to do "man gnuemacs" there to find our CBnews tips
directory, and read about special CBnews gnuemacs bugs/caveats, etc.

[9/1991: This should change in 1992: ftp archive site for the .el's and only
an exptools gnuemacs on cbnews.]

[THE COMMANDS-SOMETIMES-STICK-ON-IBM/AMDAHL BUG --Dan J.:]

From: jot@FIG.CRAY.COM (Otto Tennant)
Date: 10/1/1990
Newsgroups: gnu.emacs.bug

No one here (Cray Research) seems to have an opinion.  Thanks to 
Mr. Stallman posting a note, I learned of bug-gnu-emacs.  

I posted this to "local.mendota-only" and "local.emacs" a day or so a
go and got no response.  I really am interested in this topic.
Perhaps those of you who receive this by e-mail can forward it to
other folks you know who might have an opinion.


        A QUESTION ABOUT UNICOS AND EMACS


The first "production" release of GNU Emacs for UNICOS will
be included with UNICOS 6.0.  As we were preparing the
product, we found that Emacs would hang intermittently
whenever one attempted a 'dired' or 'man' command.
"Intermittent" here just means "not every time."  The hangs
were frequent enough to make the implementation useless.

We are pretty sure what the problem is.  UNICOS is a "USG"
type system (whatever that means.)  However, if we are
correct, the problem should occur with greater or lesser
frequency on any "USG" type system.

Under normal circumstances, Emacs is prepared to handle the
SIGCLD signal (death of a child process) with a little
routine which calls 'wait3' and then re-establishes itself
as the signal handler.  (This is routine 'sig_chld'.)  So
far as I can tell, this is morally equivalent to discarding
the signal and the zombie process into which the child may
have been transformed.

As Emacs is preparing to fork a child process to run, for
example, an 'ls' command, it changes the SIGCLD handler to
SIG_DFL, the default value.  This means that when a child
process terminates, it will be transformed into a zombie and
the event will *not* be signalled.

After the fork, the parent does a minor bit of housekeeping
and then re-establishes the original signal handler.  In the
normal course of events, it calls a routine named
'wait_for_termination' to await the completion of the child
process.  

The 'wait_for_termination' routine enters a loop in which it
checks to see if the process id it has remains valid.  The
only way out of this loop is for the process id to become
invalid. 

However, it appears to be possible for the child process to
execute, terminate, and be transformed into a zombie before
the parent has a chance to re-establish the old signal
handler.  This means that the process id will never become
invalid, since nothing will ever happen to kick Emacs out of
its 'wait_for_termination' loop.

This behaviour should be possible on any "USG" type
implementation.  Of course, the relative speed of execution
of the two processes can be affected by exogenous factors
including memory availability, swapping devices, and
scheduler policies.  We do not understand why this failure
should strike UNICOS 6.0 with such a high frequency.

Does anyone have any suggestions which might confirm our
refute our hypothesis?

(Oh, our fix.  We took out all of the signal handling stuff
and changed 'wait_for_termination' to simply call 'waitpid'.
I suspect that 'wait_for_termination' was written as it was
in the hope that a ^G would break the loop; it won't, so no
real functionality has been lost.)

Oh, the Amdahl's `uname` says "uts ihlpa 5.2.6b 5 5890" a localism,
meaning based on "SYS V.2" with some SYS V.3 add-on's or something.

It doesn't seem to occur on System V "3.2.2 3 3B2" (`uname` output).

More mail stuff: here in AT&T our mail messages sometimes aren't too
standard, i.e., I believe there always should be a blank line
separating the head from the body of the message.  When there is none,
it becomes uncomfortable to read in VM (use the t and < keys).  "Fix":
the VM people said we should have more standard mail software here.

   The function expand-mail-aliases doesn't work when there is more than

I would guess the people who wrote the code don't consider this a bug.
Following RFC822, you're supposed to separate multiple addresses with
commas.  If you put commas between the addresses, Emacs will expand all of
the aliases.

[9/1991: feedmail can show you the expansion before sending]

I notice on a modem line (with an Amdahl) rapid type-ahead with plenty
of ^G's will sometimes stall GNU Emacs, so you have to login again,

it was my clunker modem.

ispell: words with apostrophes (e.g., wouldn't) sometime cause
difficulties [due to a filter we use, I think].

[12/2990] It has been reported to us that our shell script front end,
~exptools/bin/gnuemacs, ruins your personal spell dictionary,
overwriting it each time you start up gnuemacs.  One would hope that

his territory of the project. ( 1/2 :-) )

Subject: named-shell
Summary: hack city

Scott, I now get "full smoking enjoyment and flavour" by putting

(defun named-shell (shell-name)
  "Named shells"
  (interactive "sShell name: ") 
  (cond ((get-buffer shell-name) (switch-to-buffer shell-name))
        (t (shell) (rename-buffer shell-name))))

in my .emacs file... noting that you have beefed up shell.elc in the
local/lisp directory, which is searched first before dist/lisp, giving
a more ksh-like shell mode (Do C-h m to see the key bindings),
[mostly] upwardly compatible with the documented shell-mode.

and I did do
$ ln $HISTFILE $HOME/.history (a hack)

I understand that you have plans to revise the shell-mode scene further...

[12/1990] The link keeps on getting unlinked, so now I just did "touch
~/.history" making a 0 byte file so it will shut up.

----

When reporting a exptools version specific GNU Emacs bug to us, the
providers, check: Is your exptools gnuemacs fresh?  look in the the
tips directory for things just a few weeks old, because that seems to
be the place most frequently updated.  [Occasionally machines get cut
off from the exptools blood flow...]  What? everything in the whole
gnuemacs tree is the same recent age, [but still buggy]?  Perhaps an
old version was cloned on to your machine.  Are the exptools old
crusty non-maintained ones copied over one day by somebody to your
backwater testing-only machine, or are they fresh and officially
maintained?  Also sometimes exptools updates have to be done manually
by the exptools administrators, so you might get monthly[?] clones of
a fresher file tree.

[9/1991: the "ruginfo" exptools command will show freshness.]

Anyway, take a look at .../lisp/term/*.el, .../lisp/keypad.el in the
gnuemacs file tree.

[9/1990 news flash:] Ed_Lewis_King@ATT.COM is leading a 630/730.el
development effort.

[12/1990: Ed made a 630.el, and 730.el, but it didn't win Dan J.'s
seal of approval because it ignored the "2-tierd keypad.el approach",
etc.]

"Back before his effort, I did":

in my .emacs file, I put $HOME/.emacs_/term/* in my GNU Emacs
search path.  I've got a 630.el which is almost a copy of vt100.el.
In my .emacs I have

(setq term-setup-hook

        (if (fboundp 'enable-arrow-keys)(enable-arrow-keys)) 
        )))

$USER different than your login name or maybe different than $LOGNAME,

hardcopy printer header banner, and now will put this just in a shell

You'll have nothing to cite with this message, as I'm not giving you

Hmmm, I'm forwarding this to bug-gnu-emacs@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Though
the vip mode documentation says that C-x i and C-x C-i are now
insert-file, one would think that once one switched back to emacs
mode, C-x C-i would hopefully be still indent-rigidly.

Infact, in the vip manual it says:


!Emacs Mode
!----------
!
!You will be in this mode just after you loaded VIP.  You can do all
!normal Emacs editing in this mode.  Note that the key `C-z' is
!globally bound to `vip-change-mode-to-vi'.  So, if you type `C-z' in
!this mode then you will be in vi mode.

and C-x C-i was a normal command.

Maybe a

(global-set-key "\C-x\C-i" 'indent-rigidly)

in your .emacs file after the vip stuff is loaded will fix this bug
[for you only, for now].
