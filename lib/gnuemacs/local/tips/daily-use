Subject: How do the cool folks use GNU Emacs in daily life?
From: Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM, (& Scott Thompson, Chip Webb)
Date: 8/1991

Whilst we are of course not worthy of the "cool guy" or "whiz" title,
there are certain things we would do to make GNU Emacs, pleasant -- or
at least tolerable -- for daily use:

First, the name "gnuemacs" is too long -- who wants to type in all
eight bloody characters every time they edit a file?  (We chose that
name for good reasons though, one of which was that "emacs" was
already taken in exptools by Warren Montgomery's Emacs.)  Use an alias
in your shell: I like saying "emacs" instead of "gnuemacs", so e.g.,
if I were using ksh I would have "alias emacs=gnuemacs" in the
interactive portion of the file pointed to by ksh's "ENV" variable.

"Geez", you say, "GNU Emacs takes so <BEEP>ing long to start up!  I'm
switching to that other leading brand editor!"  Woah... not so fast,
partner.  Those seconds you wait are seconds of *power*.  It takes so
long because it is high technology.  I just timed starting it up and
the best case was one second, perhaps you need a CPU upgrade :-)
(=just kidding.)  But us semi-cool types don't go around invoking it
30 times a day like one of your run-of-the-mill editors, nope.  Just
one invocation lasts a whole login session.  (And if you were using
Oliver Lauman's (net@tub.bitnet) "screen" program (for BSD UNIX) you
could have the same session across logouts, home terminal then office
terminal... weeks, months, but I digress... )

Just edit all your files in that one invocation, it's got multiple
buffers and windows.  Mail can be read and sent inside it, as Scott
Thompson has added "vm", in addition to its standard mail features.
Netnews can also be read inside it (if your system supports it yet).
Use "info" (C-h i) for more info.  In need of a shell? ...  well
Control-z will give you a subshell on systems that don't support job
control, and will suspend emacs on systems that do.  (Warren
Montgomery's Emacs users note that this behavior of C-z is radically
different from what you are used to.)  There is also a "shell" command
that gives you a shell window.  You can take advantage of
emacsclient/server found in the GNU Emacs "etc" directory.  etc.  etc.

"^P=up, ^N=down... Ugh!": just configure GNU Emacs to use your arrow
keys... and all the rest of the funny keys on your terminal while
you're at it... but I won't get into that discussion here, but see the
files in $TOOLS/lib/gnuemacs/*/lisp/term .  By the way, I customized
my .emacs file to have the system name in the buffer name line.

Scott has also added ispell, allowing interactive spell checking in
the editor, you being prompted for a replacement from a list of
choices.


------------------
You>	Groovy.  I bet there is a lot of `netnews' about GNU Emacs.

Certainly.  Scan the newsgroups lists for "gnu" and "emacs" and
"editors".  In several of these newsgroups you'll see posted monthly,
a list of frequently asked questions ("FAQ") about emacses, and their
answers.  I was thinking about putting the FAQ list in this tips
directory, but [2/1991] we are promised expanded netnews storage
capacity soon, so I'm passing on the idea.  By version 18.57, the FAQ
is now in the ..../etc directory in offical FSF version!

You>	Yeah, but what's `netnews'?

Better contact one of your friendly exptools gnuemacs providers quick
to find out what you're missing!

You>	Err, it would be keen if you put the FAQ in the tips directory.

Naww... then we would have to update it every month, and use the disk
space of having a separate copy on most exptool machines.  Just read
it in netnews.
-----------------


With the massive on-line help facilities GNU Emacs is sure to be a
great time saver in training people in need of an editor.  Its ample
(optionally numbered!) backup file copy scheme and auto-saving makes
it very hard to accidentally destroy one's precious programs while
editing.

[What? Somebody said GNU Emacs is just too good to install on their
machine, and they want to have you make do with one of those "other
leading brand" editors, or giving you the "hrmph, we only use what's
on the official tape" line?  Well just remove theirs instead, install
GNU Emacs, and inform them that GNU Emacs can probably emulate
whatever they were using anyway.  That'll teach 'em :-) :-)

Don't you hate those silly editor wars: "Your editor is like driving a
school bus to work."  "No, it's like a Mack truck, and yours is like a
little red children's wagon, and furthermore, your editor's author
said that if he knew how many people would end up using his editor, he
would have never have wrote it."  Anyway, GNU Emacs is the editor
robust enough to edit itself (it can edit "binary" files.)]

Lastly, you can feel good about learning GNU Emacs as an personal
investment because you can take it with you wherever you go (i.e.,
lay-off-proof) as there are no licensing worries, and plenty of fellow
users.

[9/1990: adding these advertisements here that used to be in the
toolnews page.]

There is no way to describe here all the features available in GNU
Emacs.  As its source code is freely available many people have
contributed modes and packages that run on it which have eventually
been accepted into the official distribution.  A few that come to mind
are its modes for emulating other editors (vi, VMS's EDT, Gosling's
Emacs (gmacs), even our very own Warren Montgomery's Emacs).  It has
X-windows, netnews reading and mail support, an on-board psychologist,
numbered backup files, "directory editor", shell windows, compilation
in one window - go to error line in another -- no fancy terminal
needed, a tree structured documentation browsing system ...

GNU Emacs is the most popular version of emacs (see USENET newsgroups
comp.emacs, gnu.emacs, comp.editors, etc.) worldwide.  It is a
standard outside AT&T.  Its availability here should increase the
productivity of many entering and current employees.

more info:

> Like, wow, how do I make ksh act as gnuemacsy as possible?
in .profile: EDITOR=gnuemacs; export EDITOR
in your ksh $ENV file: set -o emacs #wish he had "set -o gnuemacs"...
#actually waiting for full key-re-bind-ability... you know, ksh's ESC
ESC == gnuemacs' TAB...

[In fresher ksh's, you can get the arrow keys to work on most
terminals.  See "alias __".... in the ksh man page.]

Yeah.  See netnews group gnu.bash.*

Err, that's a rather brutish force method there Mel,

Let's do it the [tested once] right way.  In .emacs put:

(autoload 'c++-mode "c++-mode" "Major mode for editing C++ code." t)
(setq auto-mode-alist
      (append '(("\\.c\\+\\+$"  . c++-mode)

In e-mail, Mel raises a pertinent point:

try putting
-*-c++-*-
in a comment at the top of the c++ source files then, in addition to
the autoload line in your .emacs file.  Seems like a good solution
unless you only edit c++ all year long---in that case I would alter
the auto-mode-alist...

(server-start) in emacs
then ~exptools/lib/gnuemacs/dist/etc/emacsclient file
also can say EDITOR=~exptools/lib/gnuemacs/dist/etc/emacsclient; export EDITOR

Subject: Instructions for accessing 5ESS netnews with gnuemacs' GNUS
Date: Wed, 15 May 1991 02:08:41 GMT

[For those with access to 5ESS netnews (on certain mainframes)]

"In every specially marked box of exptools' gnuemacs there is the GNUS
netnews reader."  Actually, we put GNUS in every copy of our exptools
gnuemacs.  While this fact means lots of state of the art threaded
netnews reading excitement once widespread NNTP (Network News
Transport Protocol) service is achieved at Bell Labs, there is nothing
holding back 5ESS news users from using it as an alternative interface
rather than "5rn".  (One can also use GNUS on the cbnews machines, but
NNTP + faster processor is where GNUS really sparkles.)

To learn more about GNUS, do "toolman gnuemacs" (or "man gnuemacs"
on the cbnews machines.)  Later, after you have read all the tips
files and printed out a GNUS manual, you can use this code below in
your .emacs file to access 5ESS netnews.  These are the findings of
ihlpc!walli (Gene V Walli).  I have no access to 5ESS news.

(setq nnspool-inews-program "~5enews/lib/netnews/inews")
(setq nnspool-spool-directory "~5enews/lib/netnews/articles")
(setq nnspool-active-file "~5enews/lib/netnews/active")
(setq nnspool-history-file "~5enews/lib/netnews/history")
(setq gnus-default-distribution "5ess")

With the above declarations, you can both read and post news.

[For the time being (until we make it the default on all
architectures) people should also use Bill Carpenter's feedmail
package (see the tips directory for where to read the lisp source) to
insure that mail replies from GNUS get processed right.]

Though we are supposed to make it the default (maybe Chip has
already), and we do encourage you to look at the .el (instead of .elc)
file on the cbnews machines (do man gnuemacs there to mind the tips
directory) [a drag, yes], minimally try:

;;; Put the following lines somewhere in
;;; your ~/.emacs stuff:
;;;
;;;        (setq send-mail-function 'feedmail-send-it)
;;;        (autoload 'feedmail-send-it "feedmail")

though looking thru the feedmail.el will show you many more features
to enjoy.
