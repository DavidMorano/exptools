# mpr - General purpose shell script for printing memos containing 
# PIC figures, including CRETIN charts.
# 
# Connie O'Dell - March 28, 1989.
#
# Include a chart by putting ".so cretin.pic" in the memo.
# You don't presently have a variety of fonts to choose from, 
# only those supported by dx9700.
#
# If you want a proprietary marking at page bottoms, put .PM BP (or
# whatever the appropriate marking is) near the beginning of your document.
#
# When CRETIN is run, it uses the ppr script, which is simpler than this
# and doesn't put a page number at the top of the page.
