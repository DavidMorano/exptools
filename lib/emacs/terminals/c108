/***************************************************************
Terminal type c108 for concepts with 8 pages, Normal video Designed
by George Otto, whuxlg!otto This also sets up the cursor pad for
cursor movement: Arrowed keys move cursor as expected; PAGE
advances emacs one page, Shift-PAGE backs up a page; SCROL advances
one sentence, Shift-SCROL backs up one; TAB SET advances one word,
TAB CLR backs up one word.  MULT CODE and RESET/STAT are left
unaffected, i.e., they can still be used for their original
functions.

To make use of these changes, a macro needs to be set up that fires
on the CNTL-underbar (^_) character.

This file changes the C108 keyboard ESC character and the third
terminal attribute list at the beginning of an emacs session, then
resets them to normal at the end. If for any reason emacs aborts,
the terminal must be RESET to bring it back to normal!
