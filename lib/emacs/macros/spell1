Óruns the spell command on the current buffer [MACRO]

 This macro runs spell on the file in the current buffer, and
 finds all of the misspelled words in the buffer, allowing the
 user to edit them.  If the argument is not 1, runs spell on the
 comments in a C file.

 If the shell variable $EMACSSPELL is set and exported before emacs
 is invoked, the $EMACSSPELL will be expanded and used as command line
 options to the spell(1) command.  This is particularly useful when you
 want to have a local spelling dictionary of words that spell(1) considers
 misspelled, but you do not, e.g., acronyms, names of people, etc.

 Example:

	EMACSSPELL="+spelldict" emacs file

 Multiple options to spell(1) should be separated be white-space, e.g.:

	EMACSSPELL="+spelldict -i -b"  emacs file

 Move the cursor to the word to be found and type .
 Type ^Z to go to next match of the same word, or to return to the list
 of misspelled words if no match is found.
 Repeat the above until done, then type ° to exit this macro.
