This is a catalog of EMACS macros in the library  Not all macros are
installed on all systems, and some macros are not documented here.

balance: W. A. Montgomery (Version 3.4)
	This file contains macros to display for each closing
	parenthesis, brace, or bracket, the matching opening
	character.  It re-defines these characters to do so, and
	beeps if no match is found.  The effect on the file is the
	same as if the macro library were not there with the
	exception that } always behaves as it does in C mode.  The
	maximum nesting depth that can be handled is about 20.
	
rmail:  W. A. Montgomery (version 3.4)
	This file contains a macro put on ^Xr for processing mail. 
	It gathers new and old mail (old mail from $HOME/rmail) and
	allows the user to peruse it.  ? provides a brief
	description of the available commands.  Among others, you
	can selectively delete and undelete messages, reply to
	messages, write messages to files, and gather the most
	recent UNIX news items.
	
vmail:  W. A. Montgomery (version 4.0)
	This file contains a macro that responds to your mail while
	you are vacation.  It will copy all new mail into
	$HOME/rmail, and respond to each message, giving the date of
	the message, the file $HOME/response, and your signature to
	each.  The macro is put on ^Xv when loaded.
	The intended use of this package is to set it up to run
	periodically while you are away on vacation (or for some
	other extended period of time) via at(1) jobs or the like. 
	You do this by having the job run emacs -i <foo> where foo
	is a file that does ^X^Lvmail\n^Xv^Z.  Each time you run it,
	all new mail is replied to, and accumulates in $HOME/rmail
	awating your return.

abbrev: W. A. Montgomery (version 3.2)
	This file contains a single macro that is put on @ that
	causes abbreviations to be expanded.  The word preceeding
	the '@' is looked up in a list of abbreviations for
	expansion. The abbreviation list
	is taken from the file .abbrevs in the current directory. 
	The file contains a series of entries of the form:
	
	abbreviation@ what it expands to.  

	Everything after the "@ " up to the next line containing
	an '@' becomes the expansion of "abbreviation", so that you
	may have multi-line abbreviations if you like.
	
appropos: W. A. Montgomery (version 3.2)
	This file contains a single macro on ^X? that provides a
	different form of help information.  ^X? will prompt for a
	subject, and display help explanations for all commands and
	macros that pertain to that subject.  (actually, the subject
	is used as a search string and all help explanations that
	include the subject are displayed).
	
lcase: W. A. Montgomery (version 3.4)
	This file contains macros for converting letters or words to lower
	case.  M-l converts a single letter to lower case, while ^Xl
	converrts an entire word to lower case.
	
refmac: W. A. Montgomery (version 3.2)
	This file contains macros to interface with J. W. Leth's
	nroff pre processor (nrpp) to maintain reference lists in
	memoranda.  M-R places the user in the bibliography
	file, and allows the user to move around in the
	bibliography file through ordinary emacs commands. 
	When the user exits from the bilbliography file via
	^Z, the reference definition at the cursor position in the
	bibliography is put into the file being edited at the cursor
	position where M-R was invoked.  If the cursor position in
	the bibliography is at the beginning of the buffer, no
	reference definition is inserted into the edited file.
	^XR can be used
	while in the bibliography file to send the reference
	description at the cursor position to the department
	clerk for inclusion in the department bibliography.
	
spell: W. A. Montgomery (Version 3.4)
	This macro package contains a single macro on M-S
	that causes the spell program to be invoked on the
	file in the buffer, and causes the result to be
	analyzed.  The words found by spell are filtered through a
	local dictionary (maintained in $HOME/.dict) so that you can
	add words to your local dictionary that are not in the spell
	dictionary. 

	For each misspelled word, spell will prompt for
	action.  You can file the word in your local dictionary by
	typing 'd'. 'n' goes to the next word without looking up the
	occurances of the current word.  '?' displays instructions. 

	A space causes the cursor to move to the first occurance of
	the misspelled word.  You can then edit the file to correct
	the word and type ^Z to move on to the next occurance.  When
	you reach the last occurance, spell moves on to the next word. 

tags:	W. A. Montgomery (Version 3.6)
	Tags is a macro library that facilitates working with
	a collection of related files.  This package works
	with a tags file, which defines a set of names for
	positions in the files.  The macro placed on
	^Xf will prompt for a tag name, reads the file
	containing the position implied by the specified
	tag, and moves to the indicated position.  This is
	useful, for example, with a set of source files that
	contain C function definitions when you want to find
	a function and don't know or care what file it is in.
	
	A second macro in this package (C_TAGS) can be used
	to construct a tags file from a C source file.  When
	C_TAGS is invoked, it scans the current buffer for
	function definitions, and prompts you.  If you enter
	a space, it defines a tag whose name is the function.
	Any other character causes the current definition to
	be ignored.  Note:  If you declare functions with
	types, like char *foobar(x,y), put the type on one
	line and the function definition on a line by
	itself, otherwise this will not work.

	The command ^xt defines a tag from the current line of the
	current file, and can be used to update tags files. 

	The tags are accumulated in a buffer called .tags
	which should be saved before you exit emacs.  Tags
	from several files can be put in the same tags file
	simply by running C_TAGS on several source files. 
	There is currently no check for an attempt to
	re-define the same tag name, which will fail.	

	For those who like the nitty gritty, the format of
	the tags file is a series of entries of the form

	@<tag_name>:<file_name>:<search_string>:

	Any of the fields can contain any character
	(including newline) except : and @.  
	
debug:	W. A. Montgomery (Version 4.0)

	This library contains several useful macros for debugging
	and generaal programming.
	
	display_killstack:  Puts the items in the kill stack into a
	buffer, and allows you to examine them.
	
	PNUMB:  Converts its argument to a character string and
	leaves the result in the buffer at the current position.
	
	TO_DECIMAL:  Converts the top item of the kill stack to
	a decimal integer and returns the result.
	
loader:  W. A. Montgomery (Version 4.1)

	This file contains a number of macros to load macros from
	this library when invoked.  If you use macros like spell,
	rmail, refmac, and crypt, infrequently, load loader instead.
	When you first invoke a macro in any of those libraries it
	will be automatically loaded for you.
	
shell:	Joe Steffen and Bill Paulson (Version 4.4)
	This file contains macros that provide convenient execution
	of your frequently executed shell commands, and allow you to
	see the output of several commands at once.
	
	The M-E macro allows you to edit a file of shell commands
	called $HOME/.commands.  Enter the
	command(s) you want to execute on a line, or move the cursor to a
	different line of commands, and optionally enter ^Z to exit.  Enter
	M-^E to execute the command line the cursor was pointing at.  The
	shell output will be put into the .exec buffer and
	displayed in the bottom emacs window, unless
	the command line started with a '!', in which case the
	output will be displayed as the commands execute.

	The M-C macro displays the current line in
	this file in case you forget.  M-N and M-P move the cursor down and up,
	respectively, in the file and display the current line.  They take an
	argument just like ^N and ^P.  These commands make it easy to switch
	between several command lines without using the M-E macro.

	The ^Xs macro executes the shell interactively
	instead of prompting for each command.  This allows cd
	commands to stay in effect and allows you to see the results of
	several commands.  The prompt is changed to 'emacs' to remind you
	that you are still within emacs.  Enter ^D instead of a null line to
	return to emacs.

list:	C. Douglas Blewett (DR30L19) Version 4
	
	This file contains a command that allows the user to edit
	(recursively) a list of files.  This is much like vi's :next
	command.  The list of files is collected in .exec and the files
	are edited in .list.  This is useful for making changes in a global
	variable that appears in a list of files (e.g. ^XL *.c).
	
	If an argument other than 1 is given then the command looks up the
	file name in the directories known to contain manual pages.  This
	routine contains a string with embedded paths to the manual
	directories.
	
	An "ls -d" is performed, so full Bourne shell style wild carding is
	available.  This is very useful for manual page searches
	(e.g. ^U^XL *open*).
	
	Modified to preserve the sanity of .exec. Saves the point, mark,
	and extent of .exec.

registers: C. Douglas Blewett (DR30L19) Version 4

	This file contains two routines for implementing registers
	(like those found in MIT EMACS or TECO).  M-P copies the current
	area into the named register.  M-G copies the named register
	to the current point.

	The registers are kept in a buffer named .registers

regs:	A. J. Miller (Version 5.2)

	This is an improved version of regs that preserves registers
	accross emacs invocations, among other improvements. 
	Documentation is in the macro text.

shift:	C. Douglas Blewett (DR30L19) Version 4

	Shift a region right or left.  An argument of != 1 shift
	left, otherwise right.  This is very useful for programing
	a highly indented language.

Concept100.pad: C. Douglas Blewett (DR30L19) Version 4

	This routine handles all of the Concept100 cursor pad keys.

	This routine assumes that the escape character for the Concept
	has been changed to ^\.  This should have been done in the
	c100* terminal data base file.  All escapes are changed to ^\.
	This routine also takes advantage of the different handling of
	the comment character interactively and in macros by EMACS.

	Keys handled			Approximate translation
		HOME				M-g
		PAGE (upper and lower)		M-v and ^V
		SCROL (upper and lower)		M-3^P and M-3^N
		B TAB				^R^I
		BREAK				^G
		All of the arrowed keys		line or character movement

	Arguments supplied to these commands multiply the affect.

	The first five programmable function keys (upper and lower) are
	defined in the data base file
	(INSRT, DEL CHAR, DEL & INS LINE, CLEAR EOP & EOL, and SEND).

	Modified to my own tastes 7/5/81: added MULT, reset & stat,
	print and tape  

cc_list	C. Douglas Blewett (DR30L19) Version 4

	Compiler and list interface (arg>1 file list), (arg<1 manual pages)
	Interface routines
	
		^XL	- the main mono-lith - controls editing lists of files
		^X^@	- Creates the new command (or filename) generating routine
		^X^_	- Command or file name routine - returns on the kill stack
	
	Compiler and list interface routine.  This routine prompts for a compiler
	command (i.e. cc or make), runs it, and catches the output.  If line numbers
	are present in the output, the routine will position to the correct line.
	Three formats can be handled by this routine.
	
		"filename.c", line 23: etc.
			or
		filename.c: 23: etc.
			or
		filename.c
	
	The last format is typical ls stuff.
	
	With an argument < 1 the routine prompts for a manual page specification
	and searches the known directories for manual pages.
	
	With an argument > 1 the routine prompts for a file specification and
	searches using an "ls -d file_spec"
	
	SPECIAL STUFF FOR DEFAULT COMMANDS: WARNING creates a new routine
	
	This routine, ^XL, when used as a compiler interface calls ^X^_ to detemine
	what command to issue.  ^X^_  can be setup to return a default command
	(rather than prompting the user) by running the ^X^@ command.  ^X^@
	actually creates a new macro for ^X^_.  It isn't LISP, but it works.
	
	The compiler interface (arg == 1) reads files in using ^X^F.  No
	attempt is made to garbage collect buffers.  This does not pose a
	real problem, becuase the routine places the user in the buffer .list
	when this happens.  At that point the user can use ^X^K to remove
	un-needed buffers.  ^X^F is used instead of ^X^R because it is very
	likely with compiles that the user already has the file in a buffer
	and want to keep it there (and current).
	
	The list (arg > 1) and manual page (arg < 1) facility uses the
	buffer .list to read files using ^X^R.  These routines more or less
	automatically garbage collect buffer space.

home:	C. Douglas Blewett (DR30L19) Version 4
	
	This file contains assorted macors that help the user move quickly or
	accurately around the screen.  The central rountines are M-H and
	M-L (top and bottom of the screen).
	
	 Interface routines
		M-H - home or top of screen
		M-L - last or bottom of screen
		M-M - Middle of screen
		^\  - back one line - adds a line at the top of the screen
		^_  - forward one line - adds a line at the bottom of the screen
	
move:	C. D. Blewett, A. J. Miller -- This is a much expanded
	version of the original "home" package that contains
	additional cursor movement functions, such as scroll up and
	down, move to top and bottom of the screen, etc.

filter: Warren Montgomery, 6E-314, Version 4.3

	This file contains one macro, filter_region, which is put on
	the key M-#.

	This macro takes the marked region of the current buffer, prompts
	for a command to run, passes the text from the marked region to the
	specified command, and replaces the text from the marked
	region with the output.  Thus marking a list of names
	appearing in an nroff source and invoking M-# with the
	command "sort" will cause the list to be sorted.  The macro
	makes use of a temporary file (/tmp/$LOGNAME.emacs) to hold
	some intermediate results.

	
nlpack: Warren Montgomery 6E-314, Version 4.3
	This file contains a macro that implements a move to
	next(previous) line command that moves to the same screen
	position in the next line.  The macro is put on ^N.  It
	moves to the same cursor position in the line that follows.
	If a sequence of ^N or ^P commands is given, it tries to
	stay in the same column, even if some of the intermediate
	lines are too short.
	
	Actually, the ^N macro reads characters and carries out the
	movement so long as the character read is a ^N or a ^P.  Any
	other character breaks out of ^N.
	
	To get the same effect on ^P, invoke M-:^P^N.  when nlpack
	has been loaded.
	
	Note that this macro may be significantly slower than the
	built in movement commands.  Also, since it changes the
	built in commands ^P and ^N, it may interact with other
	macros that use them.


Draw: W. A. Montgomery (Version 4.5)

	This file contains several macros that are useful for
	drawing pictures on the screen.  These should be run in
	picture mode, with nodelete and overwrite modes set as well.

	The draw macro allows  the user to draw on the screen in
	picture mode by steering the cursor with the "home" keys of
	the right hand.  The keys uiojlm,. are used to indicate up
	and left, up, up and right, left, right, down and left,
	down, and down and right.  Each key replaces the character
	under the cursor by one of:  '-' '|' '\' or '/' and moves
	the cursor in the indicated direction.  This provides a
	simple way of drawing stick figures on the screen for use
	with gc. 
	
	The downline macro draws a verticle line of length equal to
	its argument down the screen starting from the current
	position.  This is an internal macro used by the box
	command, however it is useful in itself.  It is put on M-|
	
	The box macro draws boxes using | and -.  It draws a box
	with corners where the current position and the mark are
	set.  These can be in any corners of the desired box.  The
	cursor is left at the lower right hand corner of the box.

Keyboard Macro enhancements
	Author: George Furnas (alice!gwf)
	Date: 11/1/82
	Version: 4.5

	The allow saving a small ad hoc library of keyboard macross that can
	be referred to by name. It also allows editing the macros easily and
	is set up to encourage keeping documentation on the macros up to
	date. 

	Macros are saved in a directory $HOME/.kbdmac.dir under names
	km.NAME where NAME is the user specified name by which the keyboard
	macro is to be known, called, etc.  (The directory must be created
	ahead of time.)  

	Since the macros allow no internal documentation, a brief amount
	documentation is kept in a file called $HOME/.kbdmac.dir/README.doc
	The keyboard macro editing and renaming  macros always finish up by
	pausing with a buffer of this documentation which is to be edited
	recursively to keep it up to date. They go to old entries or create
	new ones as needed.

M-^N: name_kbdmac	names keyboard macro. prompts for name
	This allows you to save the current standard (unnamed)
	keyboard macro under the name specified. First, however,
	it pulls the macro into a buffer for perusal and/or editing 
	(idea was to at the very least make usre you knew what you
	were naming.) Then it asks for a name, and finally it
	gives you the README.doc file for any short one-line comments
	you might like to make on the newly named macro. (A
	recursive edit, exited as usual by ^Z)

M-X: execute_named_kbdmac executes named keyboard macro <arg> times
	This simply prompts for the name of the previously stored 
	keyboard macro, and executes it. It it is called with an
	argument, it executes it <arg> times.

M-^E: edit_named_kbdmac edits named keyboard macro
	This allows you to alter (edit recursively) a previously named 
	keyboard macro. It prompts for the name, pulls in the
	appropriate file, and enters a recursive edit. When you are done
	editing it (hitting ^Z, as usual) it goes and gets the
	README.doc file, at the appropriate line, in case you want to
	edit the comments on the macro. (Also a recursive edit,
	exited by ^Z)


eml:	Warren Montgomery, version 4.9


	This macro package contains macros that customize emacs for
	editing eml macro source or lisp code.  For a full
	description, see ~EMACS/macro_source/eml.e
	
netty, empty, emacsterm, eterm2:	Warren Montgomery, version 4.9
	These macro packages interface emacs to blit
	or dmd terminals running a terminal emulator designed to
	work with emacs.  For a full description on how to use them,
	consult ~EMACS/macro_source/blit-or-dmd.
	
mouse-dired:		Warren Montgomery, version 4.9
	This package contains an alternate definition for the menu
	to display under dired.  It should be loaded after loading
	netty or empty.
	

ansii:		Warren Montgomery, version 4.9
	This package transforms the ANSII standard terminal escape
	codes for the arrow keys into emacs commands.  It can be
	used with any terminal that sends ANSII codes for it's arrow keys

basic:		Joe Steffen

	This package contains some basic macro definitions and stubs
	that automatically load the common larger packages, like
	rmail and spell.

caps:	Joe Steffen, ihuxs!steffen, IH x5381, Version 4.3

	Defines the following macro:
ƒ:	capitalizes entered letters until end of word [MACRO]
	Lowercase letters are converted to uppercase until a character besides
	a lower or uppercase letter, underscore, hyphen, or backspace is entered.
	This character is then executed.  Uppercase letters,
	underscores, and hyphens are inserted as is, whereas
	backspace deletes the previous character.
	
box:		Warren Montgomery, version 4.9 

	Draws a box around the current region while in picture mode.

	
buffer_macros:	Jim Leth, version 4.5

	Some miscelaneous buffer handling macros.

draw-elipse:		Warren Montgomery, version 4.9 

	Draws an elipse in the current region while in picture mode.

edit-menu:	Warren Montgomery, version 4.9 

	Displays a menu of editing commands.  This is called from
	the netty and empty packages.  It is generally autoloaded
	when called, allowing you to define your own edit-menu in
	it's place.  See blit-or-dmd for details.
	
edit-menu2:	Warren Montgomery, version 4.9 
	An alternated editing menu called from netty or empty.
	
file_macros:	Jim Leth, Version 4.9

	Some miscelaneous file handling macros.

find-match,show-match:  Warren Montgomery, version 4.9

	This package (two names, one package) matches balanced
	parentheses.  It is called from the eml package, and from
	the empty package under some circumstances.  It defines a
	find-match macro that will find the mate to the brace or
	parenthesis under the cursor, and a show-match macro that
	does this and shows the matched pair using arrows (--><--).
	
graphics-menu:		Warren Montgomery, version 4.9

	This package defines the graphical editing menu for editing
	GC style graphics on a blit or dmd.
	
mark-c, mark-lisp, mark-text:	Warren Montgomery, version 4.9

	This package defines the action of button 2 in empty.  It
	scans what was selected to figure out what kind of object it
	is and calls on other macros to mark it.

sel:	Warren Montgomery, version 4.9

	This macro marks and highlights various text objects.  It is
	called from edit-menu2 and from the marking macros above.

cmake: Warren Montgomery, version 5.0

	This package contains macros for running c compilations or
	makes and examining the resulting errors one at a time.  Two
	commands are defined, M-c and M-m.  M-c runs "cc -O -o file file.c"
	where "file.c" is the file in the current buffer.  M-m asks
	for a command and runs it. With an argument (^UM-m), M-m
	will run "make".  Both M-c and M-m capture the result of
	what they run and scan it for error messages (Defined as
	messages containing the string " line ").  For line that
	gets an error message, you are put into two-window mode with
	the line in error in the lower buffer and allowed to edit. 
	Typing ^Z moves on to the next error.  Note that this macro
	will work on any command that produces error messages of the
	form: 
		
		"file" line #: message
		
	During editing you may add or delete lines ahead of the one
	in error without confusing the macro.  It will adjust where
	it positions you in subsequent lines in the same file to get
	the line that has the error.  It will become confused if you
	add or delete lines after the one in error.
	
vnews:  Warren Montgomery, Version 5.0

	This is a visual news interface.  It works by running
	readnews to get a list of unread articles and then allows
	you to step through them.  At each article, you can enter 
	space to read it, n to go past it, ^N or ^P to move the
	cursor without marking the article as read, r to respond to
	the author of the article, u to unsubscribe to the current
	newsgroup, q to quit (and update your .newsrc file) or x to
	exit without updating.  While reading an article, you can
	use space and p to go forward or back in pages,'n' to go on
	to the next article, 'r' to respond, and 's' to save the
	article.  The macro has an embedded pathname of the
	directory where news files are kept which may need to be
	updated.  Overall, it is a faster interface than readnews or
	vnews, because it invokes readnews once to scan for all
	unread articles at once, and following that can move to the
	next article with minimal additional calculation, file
	references, or screen update.
	
make-macro Warren Montgomery, Version 5.3

	This macro prompts for a macro name and turns the current
	keyboard macro into a real macro with that name.  It will
	ask for a key to bind to, for which you can supply either a
	single key or ^X or escape followed by a key.  If you supply
	^Z as the key, it will not bind the macro to any key.  It
	will also ask for a file to write the macro to.  Just enter
	return if you do not want to save the converted macro.
	
	make-macro may not do a perfect job of conversion.  In
	particular, if your keyboard macro makes use of any
	non-standard key bindings (generated by using M-: or loading
	macros) that over-ride the default bindings, the generated
	macro will run with the default bindings instead.  (Note
	that if you load a macro that defines a previously undefined
	key sequence the generated macro will be able to use it.  It
	is only bindings that override defaults that are lost.)

	
glob Warren Montgomery, Version 5.3

	This macro provides global action commands like ed's 'v' and
	'g'.  The macro defines M-V and M-G.  Both prompt for a
	regular expression, and check for a match between the given
	expression and every line of the file.  M-G invokes the
	macro "global_do" on every line that doesn't match, while
	M-V invokes it on every line that does.  Both operate on the
	whole buffer without arguments or the current region with
	an argument.  Both prompt the user for input on the first
	line that is a candidate for action.  space or 'y' indicate
	that the action should be done, 'n' indicates to skip this
	line, while 'R' indicates to do all the rest that are
	candidates and '^G' indicates to quit.

outline: 5.3 W. A. Montgomery
	This package is an outline processor that presents an
	outline view of an MM document.  The outline and document
	can be manipulated through single character commands to add
	sections, move sections, or edit the contents of sections or
	headers.  The package will probably work very inefficiently
	on systems where emacs is not compiled with "-DUSE_MEMORY"
version: 5.3 W. A. Montgomery
	This package reads/writes versioned files.  A versioned file
	has a suffix of ".n", n a number.  You can read "foo.<" for
	the oldest version, "foo.>" for the newest.  Writing to
	"foo.>" creates a new version and may remove an old one.  By
	default 5 versions are kept.  This can be overidden with
	the environment variable "NVERSIONS".  Reading from "foo.>" will
	create a link from "foo" to "foo.0" and read it, if no versions
	of foo exist.  Writing to foo.> will maintain a link from foo to
	the most recent version.
	
hype cshype:  5.4 W. A. Montgomery

	This package implements a crude hypertext system.  The
	system basically provides links in text files to positions
	in other text files.  The links are represented as sequences
	of characters interspersed with backspaces, so that on a
	terminal that will display underlined characters, the result
	is displayed as a single underlined special character.  The
	links are pointers to a file and a marker, where the marker
	is a sequence similar to a link.  Markers can be moved
	around and the link will continue to home in on the marker.
	Whenever you follow a link it creates a temporary link back
	to the position you left in a buffer called ".recent", that
	allows you to return to any position you left via a link.
	
	hype contains the macros for browsing and for creating
	links.  The macro bound to ^X. creates a link from the
	current position to another (move the cursor to where you
	want it to go and hit ^Z.)  The macro ^X^Z follows a link at
	the current cursor position.  This package is also
	interfaced to the eterm2 package for use with emacsterm.  If
	you load eterm2 and hype while running emacsterm on a 630 or
	5620, if you mouse on a link, it goes to where the link
	points at.  If you hit button 1 and then button 2 in the
	same place, it invokes ^X., allowing you to create a link.
	
	cshype creates hypertext links in a set of C functions.
	To use it, first remove cscope.out from the current
	directory.  Then run "cscope -c" on the files you want to
	add links to.  Run emacs on cscope.out, load in hype and
	cshype, in that order, and run M-xcshype.  It will take a
	long time with a big cscope.out, and may fail if there are
	too many files.  Don't do this on your only copy of any set
	of source files.

navigate:  Version 5.4, Warren Montgomery

	This macro presents a view of your file compressed to fit on
	one screen.  Each line actually represents the average
	length of a block of lines in your current buffer.  With
	emacsterm, you can point at a position and emacs will go
	there.  The abstract view is crude, indicating only the
	average line length.  There is another version of this macro
	called "abstract", which uses a C program to produce the
	abstract view and shows the density at each position.  Both
	macros may be useful in navigating in structured files.
	
search-list: 5.4 Warren Montgomery

	This macro (bound to ^XS) prompts for a regular expression
	and displays all matches to that expression in the current
	buffer.  You can either point at one with the mouse in
	emacsterm, or move the cursor to what you want and hit ^Z to
	move to it.
	
find-file:  5.4 Warren Montgomery

	This macro (bound to ^Xf) prompts for a file name and
	displays all matches to whatever you type.  You can either
	pick one with the mouse, type the name of a file you want to
	find, or hit ^G to abort.  This is useful when you aren't
	sure what the exact name of a file is and want to look at
	what is there without exiting to to a ls.
	
wordstar:       Raymod Konopka, Jr (November 1990)

This macro package remaps the EMACS editing commands to those used
by the WordStar editor.  This editor is primarily used in the PC
environment, and many PC programming environments have adopted 
the WordStar command set for their internal editors (eg. Turbo C,
Turbo Pascal, Norton Commander, etc.).

New macros were created where the functionality of an emacs command
differs from its WordStar counterpart.  Additionally, since WordStar
uses ^X as the down arrow key, the ^] is now the prefix key which
executes all of the emacs' ^X^{x} functions.  Therefore, all of the
window operations are still available.

The WordStar Editing Commands are:

Cursor Movement Commands

        ^D      - Right Character       ^Q^S    - Beginning of Line
        ^S      - Left Character        ^Q^D    - End of Line

This is a variant on the wordstar package that uses the keys
^L ^J ^K and ^, as a cursor pad for easy cursor control.  On most
keyboards the key configuration of these keys is similar to a PC
cursor pad and the keys are easy to type.  The complete command
set for this package is:
