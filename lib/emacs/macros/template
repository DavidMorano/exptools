Àtemplate expand template and execute commands [MACRO]

 Modifed from the abbrev macro by Bill Paulson and Keith Stanley.
 Last modified 9/8/88 by Joe Steffen to save/restore save mode.

 This macro looks for TEMPLATE FILE:<template file> in the first 10 lines
 of the file.  If none, <template file> defaults to .templates.  <template
 file> must be in your home directory.

 Templates in <template file> are of the form:

	abbreviation@ body

 The body can span multiple lines, can contain emacs commands, and should
 contain a '^' where the cursor should end up.  There can be multiple '^'s;
 you can go to succeeding ones with the M-^ macro.  For example:

	de@ #define	ƒ^	/* ^ */
	if@ if (^) {
	
	}

 Note: This macro uses mark 15 as a temporary marker.
