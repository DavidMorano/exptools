Hello, I am an AT&T text-to-speech synthesis system.
Can you understand what I am saying?
As you can hear, I process most conversational, or "textbook," text, without difficulty.
However, I have an important limitation: I interpret the end of an input line as the end of the sentence.
Therefore, this is one sentence
and this is a separate sentence.
Intonation control can, usually, be exercised, by using appropriate punctuation.
In other words, type it, the way, you would speak it!
However, sometimes, you may want to exercise more direct control.
For example, I shall now pause for 3 seconds.
\!si100\!si100\!si100 See?  It works!
\!si100 \!{T130 To indicate a change of topic, or to highlight information, change the maximum pitch range!
\!si50 \!{T160 Hello! \!si50 Hello!
\!si50 Didn't the first "Hello!" sound friendlier?
\!si50 There are also special escape sequences that one can use to \!*H*1 emphasize, or \!*H*0 deemphasize, particular words!
\!- This \!- sentence \!- sounds \!- boring \!- because \!- all \!- stress \!- accents \!- have \!- been \!- suppressed \!- for \!- all \!- words!
\!si50 Still another intonation control mechanism is what is called the "floating phrase accent."
The "floating phrase accent" \!f is especially useful \!f for separating sub-phrases \!f in what might otherwise \!f be a long drawn-out sentence.
Once in a long while, you may want to insert silence \!*H*1 inside a phrase!
However, this feature should be used with caution.
It is usually used in places \!f where the speaker should use a glottal stop.
For example, which of these two phrases sounds better: "I am here," or, "I \!> \(*[10]\) am here."
Hopefully, the second phrase sounded better!
\!si50 Another difficulty, that you may want to program your way around, is how to pronouce strange words, or acronyms.
For example, I can't pronounce this trademark very well - "Visionnaire."
However, I will now program myself to pronounce it correctly.
\[ti/visionnaire/viZ^n"eR/\]
Now I can pronounce it correctly, like so - "Visionnaire."
Similarly, I usually spell out acronyms, such as "RBOC," and "BRCS."
\[ti/rboc/"oRbok/\]
\[ai/RBOC/rboc/\]
\[ai/BRCS/bricks/\]
But, if an acronym is usually pronounced as a word, I can be programmed to do it that way, like so - "RBOC," "BRCS."
Another reason to know about acronyms is to fix a known acronym bug in my program.
For example, I usually can't pronounce this correctly at all: "ATA."
\[ai/ATA/AAtEAA/\]
However, now I can pronounce it reasonably well.
ATA is an airline.
\[ai/FREND/friend/\]
For further instructions, regarding my user programmability, please consult the FREND reference manual, as shown in my manual page.
