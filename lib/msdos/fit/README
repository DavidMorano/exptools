DOS fit for 386/486 PC:
-----------------------
To install fit on a PC, first copy fitarc.exe to a floppy. 
fitarc.exe is a self-extracting archive containing the fit files
for DOS.  DOS fit will only run on 80386 or 80486 (/SX ok too) based PCs.
You'll need about 1 megabyte of disk space for the unpacked fit files.
Assuming you now have fitarc.exe on a floppy in drive A, type the
following DOS commands:

c:
mkdir \fit
cd \fit
a:\fitarc

After fitarc is done, fit will be ready to use, just add C:\FIT to your
PATH variable and read C:\FIT\README, C:\FIT\FIT.MAN and C:\FIT\FIT.NEW.

Fit can be installed in a directory other than C:\FIT, however it is
then necessary to set the FIT_LIBRARY environment variable in your
autoexec.bat.  For example, if you install fit in D:\LANG\FIT, add the
following to your autoexec.bat:
set FIT_LIBRARY=.;D:/LANG/FIT

NOTE: for those of you who already have a copy of fit on your
PC, fitarc has a nasty habit of asking permission to copy over
a file that already exists.  This is polite, but it takes a lot
of user participation.  You may want to first backup the old files
under \FIT (just in case) and then clean out the directory.
