          The _u_p_r_i_n_t_f command generates a string value based on the
          combination of one or more specified attributes for each
          record.

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file to be used in
          reading the input table.

          The "-f" option may be used to specify the output format.
          The output format must immediately follow the -f option on
          the command line and must be surrounded by quotes if it
          contains white space or other characters recognized by the
          shell.  The output format may be anything consisting of
          string output values (i.e., any combination of characters
          and %s formats).  For example, -f%-.20s would print results
          as twenty-character left-justified string values and "-f%s
          %s" would print the concatenation of two attribute values
          separated by a space.  The valid formats are discussed in
          detail on the _p_r_i_n_t_f(3S) manual page but only the "s"
          conversion character is allowed.  All character constant
          escape sequences recognized in the C language (newline,
          horizontal tab, backspace, carriage return, form feed,
          backslash, single quote, and bit pattern) are recognize as
          part of the output format (e.g., the strings "\t" and "\n"
          are recognized as tab and newline characters, respectively).
          The number of variables to be printed (%s occurrences in the
          output format) must be less than or equal to the number of
          attributes specified to be printed; otherwise, the program
          returns an error.

          If a resultant field (_r_e_s_u_l_t clause) is not specified, only
          the fields specified as part of the output format are
          printed (projection is done on the specified fields) and
          only selected records (based on the _w_h_e_r_e clause) are
          printed.  The default format is "%s\n" which means that the
          values of first attribute specified for the command will be
          printed, one per line.  In this way, the _u_p_r_i_n_t_f command can
          be used as a simple report generator.  The input table is
          not updated.  The output is written to the standard output
          by default.  If an "_i_n_t_o clause" is specified, the output is
          written into the named table (no description file is
          created); an error is printed if the table already exists.
          If _o_n_t_o is specified instead of _i_n_t_o, the output is appended
          to the file if it already exists or the file is created and

          written if it does not exist.  The -n_c option causes all
          occurrences of the specified character _c to be translated
          into a a newline during printing.  Thus, the user can
          explicitly control where breaks occur in attribute values.
          The newline character is not printed.  The default newline
          indicator character is tilde (~).

          If a resultant field is specified, then the output is a
          UNITY table with the same fields as the input table.  The
          resultant field must be an existing terminator field.  The
          default format is "%s" which means that the result will be
          the string value of the first attribute specified on the
          command line.  By default (without an _i_n_t_o clause), the
          input table is updated.  A temporary file is updated (i.e.,
          the records satisfying the _w_h_e_r_e clause are altered), the
          original file is removed, and the temporary file is linked
          to the original table, thus updating the table.  Only one
          user may update the table at a time but any number of users
          may read the table.  The user must have write permission in
          the directory containing the table, but needs only read
          permission on the table itself.  The group and user
          identification, and mode of the table are preserved.  If an
          "into clause" is specified, the output is written into the
          named table and a corresponding description file is created;
          an error is printed if the table or corresponding
          description file already exists.  If _o_n_t_o is specified
          instead of _i_n_t_o, the output is appended to the file if it
          already exists or the file is created and written if it does
          not exist; the description file is created if it does not
          exist.  The -n option is ignored if a resultant field is
          specified.

          If the input table specified is "-", then input is taken
          from the standard input instead of a table.  The -I option
          must be used to specify the name of a table from which the
          description file name can be determined and used.

          If the output table name specified is "-", then the table
          output will be written to the standard output.  The -O
          option must be used to specify the name of a table from
          which the output description file name can be determined.
          The description file will be created in the current
          directory.

          If the "-q" option is specified, the program does not print
