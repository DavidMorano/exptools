          _u_s_e_l_e_c_t builds a new table from a subset of an existing
          table by projection and selection on an individual table.
          If attributes are specified on the command line (before the
          "_f_r_o_m"), then only these fields will be contained in the new
          table in the order specified (i.e., a projection is done on
          these fields).  Otherwise, all fields will appear in the
          output table in the order of the original table.  The
          optional "_a_s" feature allows the user to rename attributes
          during the process (i.e., uselect aname1 as aname2 ...  will
          rename the "aname1" attribute "aname2" in the description
          file for the new table).  Finally, the _w_h_e_r_e clause selects
          only a subset of the records based on some condition on the
          values of certain attributes in the the table.

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file to be used in
          reading the input table.

          The output is written to the standard output by default.  If
          an "into clause" is specified, the output is written into
          the named table and a corresponding descrition file is
          created in the current directory.  An error is printed if
          the output table already exists.  If _o_n_t_o is specified
          instead of _i_n_t_o, the output is appended to the table if it
          already exists or the table created and written if it does
          not exist.

          If the input table specified is "-", then input is taken
          from the standard input instead of a table.  The -I option
          must be used to specify the name of a table from which the
          description file name can be determined and used.

          If the output table name specified is "-", then the table
          output will be written to the standard output.  The -O
          option must be used to specify the name of a table from
          which the output description file name can be determined.
          The description file will be created in the current
          directory.  The output description file is needed only if
          the output of this command is being piped to the input of
          another UNITY command.  Otherwise, the "into clause" should
          not be used so that the output will be written to the
          standard output but a description file is not created.

          The processing time of the _u_s_e_l_e_c_t command can be decreased
          using an index created by _i_n_d_e_x.  If an index exists for the
          _f_i_r_s_t attribute appearing in the where clause and an 'or'
          operator does not appear at the same logical level as that
          attribute or above, then the index provides direct access to
          the table and thus speeds up the selection process.
          However, an index cannot be used if the input is from the
          standard input.

          If the "-q" option is specified, the program does not print
          out the number of records that are selected.

          The _u_s_e_l_e_c_t command may also be referenced by _s_e_l_e_c_t (these
          commands are linked for upward compatibility).

          The following examples, based on the description file listed
          for the /etc/passwd file on the _t_a_b_l_e(UNITY) manual page,
          show some of the features of the _u_s_e_l_e_c_t command.

          Ex. 1:  uselect -Ipasswd from - where gid leq 11 </etc/passwd

          This will print out at the terminal, all records in the
          passwd file that have a group identification number of 11.

          Ex. 2:  uselect from /etc/passwd into group11 where gid leq 11

          This will select the same records as in example 1, but the
          results will be written into the group11 table (and the
          description file Dgroup11 will also be created as a
          duplicate of the Dpasswd description file).

          Ex. 3:  uselect login uid gid from /etc/passwd \
                     where home req "^/r1"

          This command will print out the login names, and user and
          group identification numbers for all entries in the
          /etc/passwd file that have "/r1" as the beginning part of
          their login directory (a regular expression equality is done
          on the entire "home" attribute looking for those values that
          begin with the string "/r1").

          Ex. 4:  uselect login as programmer uid from /etc/passwd into tmp

          This command will select all records in the /etc/passwd file
          and for each record will output the login and user id.  The
          login attribute will be renamed programmer in the
          description file for tmp.
