          The _l_o_a_d command allows the user to load any UNIX file into
          a UNITY table.  To execute the _l_o_a_d command, the records in
          data-file must have already been carefully set up to conform
          to the definition of the table.  The description file for
          the table must exist in the present working directory, (as
          created by the _t_a_b_l_e or _m_a_k_e_t_a_b_l_e command), in the directory
          in which the table will reside, or in one of the directories
          specified in the $UNITYDFILES path (a shell environment
          variable).

          The file is checked for conformity to the description file
          before loading the table.  Due to the lack of numerical data
          types, the load command checks only for the right number of
          attributes in each record.  Records are checked by counting
          past the number of characters specified for a fixed width
          field and skipping to the termination symbol on a terminator
          field.  If less than w characters are found for a fixed
          width field or a terminator symbol is not found before a
          newline is encountered, then an error message is printed
          indicating that the record is too short.  If additional
          characters are found before a newline is encountered, then
          an error message is printed indicating that the record is
          too long.  All input records are checked before _l_o_a_d
          terminates; if any errors are detected, all records are left
          untouched in the input file.

          This command will not read the standard input nor will it
          write to the standard output (i.e., table names of "-" are
          not valid).

          If the "-q" option is specified, the program does not print
          out the number of records that are loaded.
