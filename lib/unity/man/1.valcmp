          The _v_a_l_c_m_p program is used to compile a validation table
          that has been created as described in the manual page for
          val(UNITY).  The filename argument specified, table, must be
          the name of the UNITY table for which the validation table
          has been created.  _v_a_l_c_m_p assumes that the name of the
          description file for the table is Dtable and that the name
          of the validation table is Vtable.  If these files do not
          exist in the present working directory, _v_a_l_c_m_p looks for
          them in the directory in which the table resides, and a
          directory named in the $UNITYDFILES environment variable
          path.

          The output is normally written to a file named Wtable but
          may be written to another file by specifying another file
          argument on the command line; this would normally be used by
          another program executing _v_a_l_c_m_p in such a way that if the
          program is interrupted, Wtable does not exist in an invalid
          state of completion (i.e., the output is put into the
          temporary and then linked to Wtable).

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file and validation
          script name.

          A listing of the compiled output file is printed if the "-l"
          option is specified.  The listing shows operations
          (arithmetic, logical, and machine (such as PUSHS and HALT)),
          fields, and other elements in the compiled output.  Regular
          expressions all appear as a '@'.  In general, it won't tell
          the casual user all that much.
