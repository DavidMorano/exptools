          The _r_e_g_j_o_i_n command allows the user to build a new table by
          joining two existing tables (table1 and table2).  The first
          two arguments specify the attributes on which tables table1
          and table2 are to be joined; the arguments are composed of
          one or more attributes in the respective tables, separated
          by commas (no white space is allowed in the attribute
          lists).  The join of tables table1 and table2 is composed of
          those records whose attribute values from table1 are a
          regular expression matching the attribute values from table2
          for those fields on which the join is being done.  The
          records are concatenated together with the attributes table1
          appearing first.  The attributes in table1 (i.e., the
          regular expressions) on which the join is done do not appear
          in the output.  If the last attribute of table1 is a
          terminator field (the terminator must be newline), then the
          terminator is changed to tab so that the joined record is a
          single line on output.

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file to be used in
          reading the first input table.  If the -I option is used
          twice, the second occurrance table name specified in the
          second occurrance is used to determine an alternate
          description file to be used in reading the second input
          table.  Note that this makes the -I option positional.  Even
          if an alternate description file is not desired for the
          first table, it must be entered if an alternate description
          file is desired for the second table.  In this case, the
          table name entered in the first occurrance of the -I option
          should use the same table name as as table1.

          The output is written to the standard output by default.  If
          an "into clause" is specified, the output is written into
          the named table and a corresponding descrition file is
          created in the current directory.  An error is printed if
          the output table already exists.  If _o_n_t_o is specified
          instead of _i_n_t_o, the output is appended to the table if it
          already exists or the table created and written if it does
          not exist.

          If an input table specified is "-", then input is taken from
          the standard input instead of a table.  The -I option must
          be used to specify the name of a table from which the

          description file name can be determined and used.  If the
          second table specified is "-", then two occurrances of the
          -I option must appear as described above; the first
          occurrance applies to the first table and the second
          occurrance applies to the second table.  Both table names
          cannot be "-"; one of them must be specified.

          If the output table name specified is "-", then the table
          output will be written to the standard output.  The -O
          option must be used to specify the name of a table from
          which the output description file name can be determined.
          The description file will be created in the current
          directory.  The output description file is needed only if
          the output of this command is being piped to the input of
          another UNITY command.  Otherwise, the "into clause" should
          not be used so that the output will be written to the
          standard output but a description file is not created.

          If an attribute in table1 other than an attribute on which
          the join is being done has the same name as an attribute in
          table2, then the resulting description file will have two
          attributes with the same name; this causes strange results
          when used by several of the UNITY programs.  This problem
          was solved by renaming the duplicate attribute name in the
          second description file to <attribute>1 (i.e., a "1" is
          appended to the attribute name for all duplicate pairs other
          than the joined attributes) and warning the user about the
          name change.

          Because this command does not use indexes and because it
          must compile the regular expressions dynamically, it is VERY
          SLOW!

          The regjoin command is implemented using the software ujoin
          and some conditional compilation based on whether REGJOIN is
          defined or not.
