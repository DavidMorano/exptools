          The _u_m_e_n_u command provides a menu access to the UNITY
          uselect, asort, uprint, and catalog commands.

          The only thing needed to get started is a file named _d_b_f_i_l_e_s
          in either the directory of execution or in one of the
          directories specified in the $UNITYDFILES path (a shell
          environment variable).  This file contains a list of
          database tables, one per line, to be accessed by the menu.
          The table names specified may be full pathnames for the
          tables (e.g., /usr/user1/table), relative pathnames (e.g.,
          user1/table), or simple pathnames (e.g., table).  The
          _d_b_f_i_l_e_s file may also contain "user" titles for each table
          which will be printed out by the menu program when prompting
          for table access (i.e., the actual table name is used by the
          programs for access but the "user" names are the names that
          user sees).  These may be entered by following each table
          name by appending a vertical bar (|) and then the user name.
          Any character following the vertical bar is taken to be part
          of the user name including white space.  The only
          restriction is that no line may contain a double quotes.  If
          any line in _d_b_f_i_l_e_s contains a shell meta-character, the
          line is first expanded using eeeecccchhhhoooo(1) and the shell.  Thus,
          the line

          `logdir unity`/users|USERS OF UNITY

          will be expanded to pick up the "users" file in the home
          directory of the unity login.

          In addition to providing the _d_b_f_i_l_e_s file, an _o_v_e_r_v_i_e_w file
          may be provided which gives an overview of the tables
          accessible by this menu.  It may exist in either the
          directory of execution or in one of the directories
          specified in the $UNITYDFILES path (a shell environment
          variable).  The contents of _o_v_e_r_v_i_e_w may be anything
          desirable for the application; the file is simply printed to
          the standard error output of the _u_m_e_n_u command.

          The menu starts with three options for the user.  The _o
          option prints the overview.  The _e option indicates that the
          menu will be used in expanded format; this option produces
          more verbose output and generally lists the possible options
          before each prompt.  The _n option provides for normal mode;
          this will provide a series of prompts (questions) for the
          user that is more experienced with the menu and allows for

          expanded output at each prompt by entering a question mark.
          The user first selects the table to be accessed, the
          attribute(s) to be printed, the selection criteria by which
          to select records (prompted for by attribute name, then
          comparison operator, then comparison value, optionally "and"
          or "or" and further criteria), the attribute on which to
          sort, and the output format (i.e., the use of the uprint or
          catalog command).  If user-friendly names have been provided
          in the associated description files, these are printed
          instead of the attribute names on the menus by _u_m_e_n_u and on
          final output by _c_a_t_a_l_o_g and _u_p_r_i_n_t (see _t_a_b_l_e(UNITY) for
          further information).  The example below should be provide
          any further details.

          All prompts and messages are printed to the standard error
          output; the actual output of the _u_p_r_i_n_t and _c_a_t_a_l_o_g commands
          is printed to the standard output.  This allows the standard
          output to be redirected to a file to which will contain the
          printed output while allowing the user to enter the
          necessary information at the terminal.
