          The _d_e_l_e_t_e command allows the user to delete a set of
          records from an existing table according to some criteria on
          the values of certain attributes (i.e., records satisfying
          the _w_h_e_r_e condition).  The user is not allowed to explicitly
          delete all records; a where clause must be specified.
          However, a where clause may be specified which will
          implicitly delete all records.

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file to be used in
          reading the input table.

          This command is considered an update command if a table name
          is given (not "-") and the "into clause" is not specified.
          In this case, a temporary file is updated (i.e., the records
          satisfying the _w_h_e_r_e clause are not written out to the
          temporary file), the original file is removed, and the
          temporary file is linked to the original table, thus
          updating the table.  Only one user may update the table at a
          time but any number of users may read the table.  The user
          must have write permission in the directory containing the
          table, but needs only read permission on the table itself.
          The group and user identification, and mode of the table are
          preserved.

          If an "into clause" is specified, the output is written into
          the named table and a corresponding descrition file is
          created in the current directory.  An error is printed if
          the output table already exists.  The input table is not
          locked during the update.  If _o_n_t_o is specified instead of
          _i_n_t_o, the output is appended to the table if it already
          exists or the table created and written if it does not
          exist.

          If the input table specified is "-", then input is taken
          from the standard input instead of a table (note that no
          lockfile is created).  The -I option must be used to specify
          the name of a table from which the description file name can
          be determined and used.

          If the output table name specified is "-", then the table
          output will be written to the standard output.  The -O
          option must be used to specify the name of a table from
          which the output description file name can be determined.

          The description file will be created in the current
          directory.  The output description file is needed only if
          the output of this command is being piped to the input of
          another UNITY command.

          If the "-q" option is specified, the program does not print
          out the number of records that are deleted.
