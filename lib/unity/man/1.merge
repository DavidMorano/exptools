          _m_e_r_g_e will merge several records together to form one record
          where all attribute values of each record merged are the
          same except for the attribute on which the merge is being
          done.  The resulting merged attribute is composed of the
          values of the merged attribute for each of the records
          merged separated by a separator character.  The default
          separator character is comma(,) and may be changed using the
          -_sc option.  The merged attribute must be a terminator
          field.  _m_e_r_g_e assumes that the records are in sorted order
          by all attributes other than the attribute on which the
          merge is being done (with the first attribute not being
          merged being the most significant sort key, the second
          attribute not being merged being the second most significant
          sort key, etc.).  _m_e_r_g_e prints an error message and the
          record that is out of order and exits if the records are not
          in sorted order.

          _u_n_m_e_r_g_e is the reciprocal function of _m_e_r_g_e and breaks a
          single record into multiple records where each of the new
          records has the same attribute values for all attributes
          except the attribute on which the unmerge is being done.
          That attribute will have the first part of the original
          value (all characters up to the separator character) on the
          first output record, etc.

          For either command, if the -I option is used, the table name
          specified is used to determine an alternate description file
          to be used in reading the input table.

          For both commands, the output is written to the standard
          output by default.  If an "into clause" is specified, the
          output is written into the named table and a corresponding
          descrition file is created in the current directory.  An
          error is printed if the output table already exists.  If
          _o_n_t_o is specified instead of _i_n_t_o, the output is appended to
          the table if it already exists or the table created and
          written if it does not exist.

          If the input table specified is "-", then input is taken
          from the standard input instead of a table.  The -I option
          must be used to specify the name of a table from which the

          description file name can be determined and used.

          If the output table name specified is "-", then the table
          output will be written to the standard output.  The -O
          option must be used to specify the name of a table from
          which the output description file name can be determined.
          The description file will be created in the current
          directory.  The output description file is needed only if
          the output of this command is being piped to the input of
          another UNITY command.  Otherwise, the "into clause" should
          not be used so that the output will be written to the
          standard output but a description file is not created.

          If the "-q" option is specified, the program does not print
          out the number of records that are merged (or unmerged).
