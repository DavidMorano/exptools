          _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e is a table validator as described on the _v_a_l(UNITY)
          manual page.  The validator validates files in the form of
          UNITY tables:  this means that the records must contain a
          fixed number of fixed width or terminator fields as
          described on the manual page for _t_a_b_l_e(UNITY).

          The default method for using _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e is to name the table
          to be validated as the only argument; the names of three
          auxiliary files needed as described below are determined
          from the simple file name of the specified table.

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate set of auxiliary files (described
          below).

          If the input table specified is "-", then input is taken
          from the standard input instead of a table.  The -I option
          must be used to specify the name of a table from which the
          auxiliary files can be determined.

          Before _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e can be invoked, three additional files to be
          associated with the table must be created.

          Description file:
             This file contains a description of the layout of the
             fields within the table as well as whether a field is a
             fixed length field (and its associated length) or a
             terminator field (and its associated terminator).  Field
             names may be up to 11 characters in length, must begin
             with an alphabetic character, and may contain only
             alphanumeric characters or underscore (_).  The format is
             further described on the _t_a_b_l_e(UNITY) manual page.  The
             name of this file must be D<table> for a table with
             simple file name <table> and must reside in the current
             directory, the same directory as the table, or in one of
             the directories specified in the $UNITYDFILES path
             environment variable when _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e is executed.

          Validation script:
             This file contains the validation criteria for the table.
             The name of this file must be V<table> for a table with
             simple file name <table> and must reside in the current
             directory, the same directory as the table, or in one of
             the directories specified in the $UNITYDFILES path
             environment variable when _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e is executed.  The

             format of the validation table is as described on the
             val(UNITY) manual page.  _v_a_l_c_m_p produces the object file
             W<table> in the current directory automatically when
             W<table> does not exist or its modification date is older
             than V<table>.

          Error Table:
             This table defines error messages corresponding to the
             error codes used in the validation table.  The table has
             two columns:  the first column contains the error code as
             used in the validation script table and the second column
             (separated from the first by a tab) contains the
             associated error message.  The name of this file must be
             E<table> for a table with simple file name <table> and
             must reside in the current directory, the same directory
             as the table, or in one of the directories specified in
             the $UNITYDFILES path environment variable when _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e
             is executed.  If this table does not exist, the error
             codes are printed out when an error occurs instead of the
             corresponding error message.

          As an example, suppose the /etc/passwd file is to be
          validated.
          The file Dpasswd could be as follows:

          login  t:      8l       LOGIN NAME
          passwd t:      14l      PASSWORD
          uid    t:      5r       USER ID
          gid    t:      5r       GROUP ID
          acct   t:      20l      ACCOUTING INFORMATION
          home   t:      15l      HOME DIRECTORY
          shell  t\n     12l      LOGIN SHELL

          The file Vpasswd could be as follows:

          login % "[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]{1,6}"                          l1
          passwd == ""
                  shell == "/bin/rsh" | shell == "/bin/uname" | \
                          shell == "/bin/sync"                        p1
          uid % "[0-9]{1,5}"                                          u1
          gid % "[0-9]{1,5}"                                          g1
          dept % "[0-9]{1,5}"                                         d1
          home != ""                                                  h1

          The file Epasswd could be as follows:

          l1      login must be 1-6 alphanumeric characters
          p1      entry must have a passwd
          u1      user id must be 1-5 numeric characters
          g1      group id must be 1-5 numeric characters
          d1      department number must be 1-5 numeric characters
          h1      entry must have a home specified

          The /etc/passwd file could be validated by executing:
             validate /etc/passwd
          or validate -Ipasswd < /etc/passwd
          or validate -Ipasswd /etc/passwd

          Messages associated with error codes are written on the
          standard error output.  If a message cannot be found
          corresponding to the error code, the error code itself is
          written out.  In either case, the record in error is printed
          first followed by one or more lines with the record number
          on which the error occurred followed by the error message.
          Diagnostic messages from the machine are also printed on the
          standard error output.  _v_a_l_i_d_a_t_e exits with a non-zero exit
          code if any error occurs and 0 otherwise.
