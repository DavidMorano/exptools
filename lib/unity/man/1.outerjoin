          The _o_u_t_e_r_j_o_i_n command allows the user to build a new table
          by doing an outerjoin on two existing tables (table1 and
          table2).  The first two arguments specify the attributes on
          which tables table1 and table2 are to be joined; the
          arguments are composed of one or more attributes in the
          respective tables, separated by commas (no white space is
          allowed in the attribute lists).  The outerjoin of tables
          table1 and table2 is composed of those records whose
          attribute values from table1 equal the attribute values from
          table2 for those fields on which the outerjoin is being done
          PLUS all records from table1 which do not have a matching
          record (i.e., a record with equal attribute values) on
          table2.  The records are concatenated together with the
          attributes from table1 appearing first.  The attributes in
          table2 on which the outerjoin is done do not appear in the
          output since they are a duplicate of the attribute values in
          table1.  If the last attribute of table1 is a terminator
          field (the terminator must be newline), then the terminator
          is changed to tab so that each joined record is a single
          line on output.  For table1 records for which there is no
          matching table2 record, the table2 attributes on output are
          null values; terminator fields consist only of the
          terminator and fixed with fields are padded with spaces.

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file to be used in
          reading the first input table.  If the -I option is used
          twice, the second occurrance table name specified in the
          second occurrance is used to determine an alternate
          description file to be used in reading the second input
          table.  Note that this makes the -I option positional.  Even
          if an alternate description file is not desired for the
          first table, it must be entered if an alternate description
          file is desired for the second table.  In this case, the
          table name entered in the first occurrance of the -I option
          should be the same as table1.

          The output is written to the standard output by default.  If
          an "into clause" is specified, the output is written into
          the named table and a corresponding descrition file is
          created in the current directory.  An error is printed if
          the output table already exists.  If _o_n_t_o is specified
          instead of _i_n_t_o, the output is appended to the table if it
          already exists or the table created and written if it does

          not exist.

          If an input table specified is "-", then input is taken from
          the standard input instead of a table.  The -I option must
          be used to specify the name of a table from which the
          description file name can be determined and used.  If the
          second table specified is "-", then two occurrances of the
          -I option must appear as described above; the first
          occurrance applies to the first table and the second
          occurrance applies to the second table.  Both table names
          cannot be "-"; one of them must be specified.  The indexes,
          as described below, cannot be used on a table that is read
          from the standard input.

          If the output table name specified is "-", then the table
          output will be written to the standard output.  The -O
          option must be used to specify the name of a table from
          which the output description file name can be determined.
          The description file will be created in the current
          directory.  The output description file is needed only if
          the output of this command is being piped to the input of
          another UNITY command.  Otherwise, the "into clause" should
          not be used so that the output will be written to the
          standard output but a description file is not created.

          To perform the outerjoin operation efficiently, table2 must
          have an index on the first join attribute specified for
          table2.

          If an attribute in table1 other than an attribute on which
          the outerjoin is being done has the same name as an
          attribute in table2, then the resulting description file
          will have two attributes with the same name; this causes
          strange results when used by several of the UNITY programs.
          The program attempts to solve the problem by renaming the
          duplicate attribute name in the second description file to
          <attribute>1 (i.e., a "1" is appended to the attribute name
          for all duplicate pairs other than the joined attributes)
          and warning the user about the name change.

          If the "-q" option is specified, the program does not print
          out the number of records that are outerjoined.
