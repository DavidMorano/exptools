          The _s_e_t_d_i_f_f command allows the user to build a new table by
          finding the difference of two sets of attribute values, one
          from each of two existing tables (table1 and table2).  The
          set difference of tables table1 and table2 is made up of
          those records from table1 that will not appear in the output
          of a _u_j_o_i_n(UNITY) command with the same arguments.  The
          arguments may be reversed to get those records in table2
          that will not appear in the output of a _u_j_o_i_n(UNITY) command
          with the same arguments.

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file to be used in
          reading the first input table.  If the -I option is used
          twice, the second occurrance table name specified in the
          second occurrance is used to determine an alternate
          description file to be used in reading the second input
          table.  Note that this makes the -I option positional.  Even
          if an alternate description file is not desired for the
          first table, it must be entered if an alternate description
          file is desired for the second table.  In this case, the
          table name entered in the first occurrance of the -I option
          should be the same as table1.

          The output is written to the standard output by default.  If
          an "into clause" is specified, the output is written into
          the named table and a corresponding descrition file is
          created in the current directory.  An error is printed if
          the output table already exists.  If _o_n_t_o is specified
          instead of _i_n_t_o, the output is appended to the table if it
          already exists or the table created and written if it does
          not exist.

          If an input table specified is "-", then input is taken from
          the standard input instead of a table.  The -I option must
          be used to specify the name of a table from which the
          description file name can be determined and used.  If the
          second table specified is "-", then two occurrances of the
          -I option must appear as described above; the first
          occurrance applies to the first table and the second
          occurrance applies to the second table.  Both table names
          cannot be "-"; one of them must be specified.  The indexes,
          as described below, cannot be used on a table that is read
          from the standard input.

          If the output table name specified is "-", then the table
          output will be written to the standard output.  The -O
          option must be used to specify the name of a table from
          which the output description file name can be determined.
          The description file will be created in the current
          directory.  The output description file is needed only if
          the output of this command is being piped to the input of
          another UNITY command.  Otherwise, the "into clause" should
          not be used so that the output will be written to the
          standard output but a description file is not created.

          To perform the setdiff operation _e_f_f_i_c_i_e_n_t_l_y, table2 must
          have an index on the first attribute on which the join is
          done (a2a).

          The _s_e_t_d_i_f_f command is used when it is important to find out
          which records from a table will be lost when a _u_j_o_i_n(UNITY)
          is done with another table.

          If the "-q" option is specified, the program does not print
          out the number of records that are in the set difference

          As another example, suppose I want to alter a field, say
          field1, of a table, say table1, for only a selected portion

          of the table that does not fit into any groupings available
          using the _w_h_e_r_e clause.  It can be accomplished by putting
          the keys of those records to be altered into a file, say
          table2 (as well as creating an appropriate description file
          with a single field, say key), and executing the following
          sequence of commands:

          ujoin key key from table1 table2 into tmp
          alter field1 to "newvalue" in tmp
          setdiff key key from table1 table2 >> tmp
          mv tmp table1

          The table table1 has been modified so that all records whose
          key appears in table2 have the field1 attribute set to
          "newvalue"; all other records appear the same as before.

          Another use for this command is to compare _a_l_l attributes of
          two different tables with the same format (e.g., an old and
          new version of the same table).  The output will be those
          lines that are different between the tables.
