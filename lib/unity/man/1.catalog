          The _c_a_t_a_l_o_g program provides a printout of a UNITY table in
          vertical (rather than tabular form) for those records that
          satisfy the _w_h_e_r_e condition.  The attribute name is printed
          in the left margin and then the attribute value is printed.

          _c_a_t_a_l_o_g automatically handles wrapping attribute names and
          values onto more than one line if it encounters a lengthy
          value.  By default, up to 34 characters are printed for the
          attribute name in the left margin, space characters fill up
          to column 35, and up to 44 bytes of the attribute value are
          printed on a single line.  Continuing attribute names begin
          at column 1 and continuing data values begin at column 35.
          An attribute name and attribute value is broken at the last
          space, comma, semi-colon, colon, or if not found, the last
          non-alphanumeric character that can fit on a line for the
          attribute.  Blanks that would appear at the beginning of the
          next line are ignored.  If the value does not have a non-
          alphanumeric character that fits on the line, the program
          will split the value at the end of the line.

          Two lines of dashed lines are printed between each record or
          tuple.

          _c_a_t_a_l_o_g can also be used to output only some of the
          attributes of a table, thus incorporating the effect of a
          projection function.  If no attribute names are specified,
          then all attributes of the table are printed.  If a list of
          attributes appears, then the output will contain only those
          fields listed in the order that they appear.  Duplicate
          attribute names are allowed and the number of attributes
          specified is limited by the number of attributes allowed in
          a description file (currently 100 attributes).

          The "user-friendly" names are printed instead of the
          attribute names if they are stored in the description file
          (see _t_a_b_l_e for details).

          If the -I option is used, the table name specified is used
          to determine an alternate description file to be used in
          reading the input table.

          The command line options are as follows:

          -w_k  The width of lines is set to _k character positions.  By
               default, the print width is 79 characters per line; the
               default was chosen so that tables will be printed
               nicely on video terminals.  The minimum width that may
               be specified is 10 characters.  This width also
               controls the width of the separator lines.

          -d   A blank line is printed between each attribute value
               (double-spacing).

          -m_k  The width of the left margin is set to _k character
               positions.  By default, the left margin, in which the
               attribute names are printed, is 35 characters.  This
               means that up to 34 characters of attribute name are
               printed and spaces are used to fill up to column 35.
               Attribute values are printed in columns 36 up to the
               width of the page (default 79 characters).  The print
               width for attribute values is equal to the page width
               minus the margin width.  Thus, increasing the margin
               size without increasing the page width will cause the
               print width for attribute values to decrease.

          -l_k  The length of a page is set to _k lines.  If "-l" is
               specified with no page length, the default is the
               standard UNIX default of 66 lines per page.  The
               minimum allowable page length is 10.  Each record
               begins printing on a new page with this option and the
               printing of the dashed separator lines is suppressed.

          -n_c  This option causes all occurrences of '_c' to be
               translated into a skip to the next line.  Thus, the
               user can explicitly control where breaks occur in
               attribute values even if the value would not fill the
               line.  The newline character is not printed.  This
               option takes priority of normal line splitting.  The
               program will first scan for a newline character.
               Failing to find one, it scans backwards trying to find
               a break character _o_n_l_y if the entire attribute value
               will not fit on the current line.  Failing to find a
               break character, it splits the attribute value exactly
               at the width of the line.  Note that all strings
               between the newline delimiters must be less than or
               equal to the 40 characters per line.  The default for _c
               is tilde (~).

          -b   This option will suppress the printing of blank
               attributes.  That is, if a value does not exist for an
               attribute, the line (which would consist only of the
               attribute name) is not printed.

          -e   Record numbers are printed at the beginning of each
               record (enumeration).  If the -l option is specified,

               then a separate line is printed at the beginning of
               each record in the form "--- # ---", where "#" is the
               number of the record being printed (records which are
               in the database file but not printed are not included
               in the count).  If the -l option is not specified, then
               the record number is printed on the second of the
               dashed separator lines.

          -h   The next argument is used as a header to be printed at
               the top of each page.  Four blank lines will be printed
               at the top of the page, followed by the header line,
               followed by two blank lines, and the data.  The header
               argument may consist of multiple lines but it is the
               user's responsibility to account for the right number
               of lines appearing on the page (e.g., if the header
               consists of two lines, the user should specify -l65 to
               get the right number of data lines output for a default
               page length of 66 lines).  Note that '\n' is _n_o_t
               expanded to a newline.  The only expansion that is done
               is that "%d" expands to the current page number.  A
               side effect of this is that the user must specify "%%"
               to get a single "%" printed (problems may occur if a
               "%" is used in any other way).  This option is ignored
               if the -l option is not specified.

          -f   The next argument is used as a footer to be printed at
               the bottom of each page.  The bottom of the page output
               will consist of two blank lines, followed by the footer
               line, and followed by two more blank lines.  The footer
               argument may consist of multiple lines but it is the
               user's responsibility to account for the right number
               of lines appearing on the page (e.g., if the footer
               consists of two lines, the user should specify -l65 to
               get the right number of data lines output for a default
               page length of 66 lines).  Note that '\n' is _n_o_t
               expanded to a newline; use an actual newline as part of
               the value within quotes.  The only expansion that is
               done is that "%d" expands to the current page number.
               A side effect of this is that the user must specify
               "%%" to get a single "%" printed (problems may occur if
               a "%" is used in any other way).  This option is
               ignored if the -l option is not specified.

          The _c_a_t_a_l_o_g program has no limitations regarding the amount
          of data that can be printed.  The program prints lines as
          they are generated rather than setting them up in arrays.
          The resulting program has no data limitations.

          The output is written to the standard output by default.  If
          an "into clause" is specified, the output is written into
          the named table.  An output description file is not created
          since the output of the catalog command is not a UNITY

          description file name can be determined and used.
