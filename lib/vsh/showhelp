			Showfile Command Summary

Command		Description

a-z		Examine line for a file name and line number.
		If a file name is found, run the editor on this file.

^D or ^Z	Leave Showfile.

In addition to the previous commands, most of the commands from the
directory page are available in showfile with the exception of L and R. 
Particularly useful are M and G, which allow new iterations of Make and
Grep; !, which escapes to the shell; and F, which allows one to edit any
file.

To return to showfile display from Vsh, use E to review the
last .makerror file and S to show the last .grepout file.

Vsh always searches for .makerror in the current directory.  Vsh
searches for .grepout first in the current directory, then in your
home directory.

When a line is selected, Vsh tries to extract a file name and line
number from it.  Because the output from grep is of constant format, a
selection will never fail with grep. Vsh tries its best with the output
of compilers and lint.
