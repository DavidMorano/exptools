[Exptools tex package. 9/1990 Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM]

What did I put in this directory?  Most of the official things from a
few directories on labrea.stanford.edu, and most of Terry L.
Anderson's distribution (he wrote the README.tla)...

What is the next logical place to look for things you miss here?
sun.soe.clarkson.edu:/pub/latex-style/*

It's tough to draw the line on what to add here... I was hoping to
just ftp from a few "sacred directories" out there...
