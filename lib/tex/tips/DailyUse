Ok... I want to print something on paper.  It's written in LaTeX.
What do I do?

$ latex file.tex		#makes file.dvi
	#["underfill" & "overfill" messages are usually no big deal]

$ latex file.tex		#a second time (if necessary) to get
				#references right

$ dvips -o file.ps file.dvi	#makes file.ps (PostScript)
#[then relax while it runs MetaFont, it making some files in /usr/tmp/... if
#necessary]
$ prt -l postscript file.ps	#works at least in IH, Naperville, Illinois

#[see the dvips toolman page for new shortcuts to the
#above---eliminating the need to make an intermediate PostScript
#file.]

If it is a [e.g., TeXinfo mostly, I think] file with an index, use
this procedure.  Let's pretend the file is called emacs.tex:

1) Run tex on emacs.tex, producing emacs.cp, emacs.fn, emacs.ky,
and emacs.vr (unsorted index files), plus emacs.aux (cross ref file).

2) run texindex [currently (3/1991) located in $TOOLS/lib/tex/bin]
   "texindex emacs.??"
This produces sorted index files emacs.cps, emacs.fns, etc.
that are used as input in step 3.

3) Run tex on emacs.tex again.

4) Now you have a dvi file [that you can run dvips on as above].

Personally I am usually found running LaTeX from a Makefile inside GNU
Emacs' (exptools command name: "gnuemacs") compile mode, in contrast
to say, invoking the editor from LaTeX as stated on the man page.  [No
I don't have a package to make GNU Emacs jump to the line with the
TeX/LaTeX error number on it, as it can do with, e.g., C compiler
errors.]  [In the Makefile, say e.g., latex ..... < /dev/null, not
latex ....  <&-, as the latter seems to start munching the
$TOOLS/bin/latex front end scripts comments as keyboard input!]

I also use ispell (see the documentation for the exptool GNU Emacs
("gnuemacs"), as ispell is presently (11/1990) bundled with exptools
GNU Emacs) to interactively spell check my documents.  ispell can be
used as a stand-alone or inside GNU Emacs (GNU Emacs can emulate the
vi editor, etc., by the way, and has a LaTeX-mode, etc.)

I couldn't get by without Terry L. Anderson's AT&T documentstyle
macros.  Run ../macros/tm.doc thru LaTeX, etc. as above to print out
Terry's main document read about his macros.

Read the netnews groups comp.text.*, comp.fonts, and att.text.tex.
For more info on netnews write to me, Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM.

Subject: IH printers for tex and latex

When directing a file produced by 'dvips' to a Comp Center
printer at IH, route the job to "ihkodak1":

	prt -lpost -dihkodak1 file.ps

That printer produces good readable hardcopy from such
files; other printers may produce output with spidery
(thin) characters that are harder to read.

[ You can also use "-Pqms" on the dvips command line.  This produces heavier
characters.  See "Fonts" for more information.  -- Mark Hrtman ]
