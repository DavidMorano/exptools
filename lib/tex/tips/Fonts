[ The following list of questions and answers addresses fonts and how they
are handled in exptools TeX.  Please feel free to suggest corrections,
additions, or improvements to this list to the TeX providers.  -mah ]

> Which fonts are currently available in exptools TeX?

The following font families are currently provided in exptools TeX:

1.  Computer Modern - the standard set of Computer Modern fonts should
be available.  If you find a font that is missing or out-of-date, please
contact the providers and we will update it.

2.  PostScript fonts - TFM and VF files for a subset of the standard
PostScript fonts are distributed.  These consist mainly of the Times,
Helvetica, and Courier families, plus a few miscellaneous fonts.  See
the discussion below for more details on using PostScript fonts.

3.  AMS Symbol fonts - only the symbol fonts are currently distributed,
not the other AMS font families (Euler and Cyrillic).  To use the normal
AMS symbol definitions from TeX or LaTeX, include the following near the
top of your input file:

\input{amssym.def}
\input{amssym.tex}

The first file defines the \newsymbol macro from AMS-TeX, while the
second contains the actual definitions for the AMS symbols.

> How can I use native PostScript fonts in my TeX documents?

To use PostScript fonts, TeX needs a TFM file so it knows the proper
spacing for each character in the font.  In addition, VF files are
used to map characters from TeX's character set to Adobe's.  (This is
a simplification; two TFM files and one VF file are actually used for
most fonts.)

Currently, TFM and VF files for the Times, Helvetica, and Courier font
families (along with some other fonts) are available under
~exptools/lib/tex/fonts.  For LaTeX users, a style file (times.sty) is
provided to transparently use the PostScript Times family instead of the
Computer Modern family.  To use PostScript fonts from plain TeX, or
to use fonts other than those specified in times.sty, you must know
the names used to access the PostScript fonts.  The naming scheme
used in exptools is described in detail in TUGboat, Volume 11, Number 4,
pages 517-520.  The names for the 35 standard PostScript fonts are listed
below.  Note that all fonts are not currently distributed -- contact the
exptools TeX providers for specific needs.

> What if the font I want to use is not in exptools TeX?

With the large number of Metafont fonts available, it is likely that you
may wish to use fonts that we have chosen not to provide in exptools TeX.
The first step in doing this is to acquire the Metafont source files for
the fonts (.mf files) and place them in a directory.  Then, add this
directory to your MFINPUTS environment variable.  You can then generate a 
TFM file for each font you wish to use by running Metafont:

$ mf "\mode:=localfont; mag:=1.0; scrollmode; input yourfont.mf"

The mode and mag used do not really matter, since they do not
affect the TFM file; only the GF file which you can discard.
Place your newly created TFM files in another directory, and add this
directory to your TEXFONTS environment variable.  You may now use
the new fonts as you would any others.

Some additional notes:

a)  You can place both the Metafont source files and the TFM files in
your current directory, since "." is in both paths by default.

b)  For some fonts you may have TFM and PK files, but not the Metafont
source files.  In this case, place the TFM files somewhere in your
TEXFONTS path, and place the PK files where dvips can find them (see
the dvips man page or continue reading this tips file for more details).

One major problem with TeX and the Computer Modern fonts is the huge amount
of disk space a full set of high-resolution fonts can take.  Dvips uses fonts
stored in PK format.  Since they are basically bitmaps, separate files are
required for each size (or magnification) of each font.  This multiplies out
to more disk space than exptools could be expected to allocate to TeX.  The
dvips program solves this problem by creating fonts on demand, so only those
fonts that are actually used are stored on disk.  At a typical site, less
than one fifth of the full set of Computer Modern fonts are used over a long
period, so this saves a great deal of disk space.  The downside is that it
does take a certain amount of time to create a new font if it has not been
accessed recently.

The PK files generated by dvips reside in /usr/tmp/pk.XXX (where XXX varies
according to your printer type).  In theory you only need to do the
METAFONT processing once.  Unfortunately, some machines clean up /usr/tmp
somewhat aggressively (often several times a day).  Thus, the first time
your process your document, fonts are created in /usr/tmp/pk.XXX.  If you
run dvips again (within a reasonable period of time), the fonts in
/usr/tmp/pk.XXX will be used and you will not have to wait for METAFONT to run.
However, when the crontab entry runs and cleans out /usr/tmp, you get to start
all over again.

Several PK files are kept pre-made under ~exptools/lib/tex/fonts.  This set
does fluctuate, so input on fonts you find yourself rebuilding often is
appreciated.

> Is there an easy way to save the fonts generated by METAFONT for later use,
> and if so, how?

Yes.  Copy the generated files from /usr/tmp/pk.XXX into a private directory.
Then, add that directory to the TEXPKS path environment variable or modify the
"P" flag in your .dvipsrc appropriately (TEXPKS overrides the config and
.dvipsrc files).  Look at the "P" flag in ~exptools/lib/tex/config.* for what
this path should contain.  The following is appropriate for Imagen fonts
(the default) using the environment variable approach:

TEXPKS=.:$HOME/myfonts:/usr/tmp/pk.imagen:$TOOLS/lib/tex/fonts
export TEXPKS

Dvips will now search your private directory, in addition to the exptools
and /usr/tmp/pk.XXX directories, to find PK files.  It will still invoke
METAFONT for fonts that it can't find anywhere in the path.

This does open up the potential for you to have out-of-date fonts in your
directory (for example, if the font source files are changed), so please
don't abuse this option.

> The characters in my output appear unusually thin, especially when the
> printer is low on toner.  Why does this happen?

This happens because the default fonts are built with parameters for the
Imagen (Canon print engine), and you may be using something with a Xerox print
engine (a QMS perhaps?).  To allow for this possibility, dvips supports
separate fonts for Imagen and QMS printers.  You may want to try QMS fonts,
which are considerably heavier (check out waits.mf in ~exptools/lib/tex/mf if
you are interested).  This can either specified with either a -Pqms on the
command line, a PRINTER=qms in your environment, or some appropriate
modifications to your .dvipsrc file.  This will work for any printer with a
Xerox engine, not just the QMS.  In fact, it will work on any printer if
you just want heavier output.
