Subject: How to get us to install the TeX package on your favorite
	exptool machine

Since the tex package (TeX, LaTeX, etc.) is an "optional" exptool, you
won't necessarily find it on all exptools machines.  The current
method to try to get it installed on your exptools machine is to send
your requests to the current tex providers, who can be listed out with
this command:
			    providers tex

If your machine is not currently receiving exptools, arrangements can
still probably be made.
