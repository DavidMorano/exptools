tex/latex/slitex: =================================

Our front end script $TOOLS/bin/tex (take a look at it.  It's also
linked to $TOOLS/bin/latex and $TOOLS/bin/slitex), appends the various
paths so the user need not worry about them.

$TOOLS/lib/tex/macros is a good place to look for files you've heard
about, like sample.tex and story.tex (mentioned in the TeX and LaTeX
books), also AT&T macros.  You might poke around the whole
$TOOLS/lib/tex file tree for other items of interest, like metafont,
etc.

[3/1991]: texindex, one of the steps in making TeXinfo output, is in
$TOOLS/lib/tex/bin .
