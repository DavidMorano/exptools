The docgen program with the -mcs option is designed to help you generate
a document cover sheet without understanding or remembering the special
cover sheet formatting command names. Simply answer the questions with the
correct information (or type a carriage return to indicate that there is
no information).

In several instances you will be given the choice of reading the text from
a file (by typing ':r' followed by the filename) or typing the information in
directly. If any of the following items are lengthy, it probably will be most
convenient to read the data from a file prepared earlier: abstract, complete
copy distribution list, cover sheet only distribution list. If you have no data
to input for any one of these items, simply type a colon(:) followed by a
carriage return.

After you have answered all the questions, you will find that docgen has
written (or appended) the information to the output file (default temp.cover)
in your directory.
