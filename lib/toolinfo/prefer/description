Prefer is a troff preprocessor that formats bibliographic references.  It
knows about various reference styles and can be used with or without the
monk(1) document preparation system.  Penter helps create bibliographic
databases interactively.  Pconvert will convert a refer(1) database to
prefer(1) format.
