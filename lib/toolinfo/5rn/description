The 5rn(1) exptool is a version of the popular rn(1) netnews reader adapted
for use with 5ESS news.  In general, it allows the news reader to zip through
articles with a minimum of waiting, and is user-configurable.

This version is exactly the same source code used on the Bell Labs news
servers in Columbus.  Only the configuration has been changed to recognize
the 5enews heirarchy.

Note that 5rn(1) is only available on those machines that support 5enews.
These are generally 5ESS Development Maxis.  It eventually (perhaps 1 year)
will be re-homed for support by the 5enews logins.

See the 5rn(1) exptool manual page for more details on this package.
