gmacs is a text editor written by James Gosling at Carnegie-Mellon
University, styled after the EMACS editors that exist on ITS, Twenex
and Multics.  Invoking gmacs with a list of files causes gmacs to start
up and do a visit-file on each of the named files.

The command teach-gmacs(1) will put the user into gmacs in a
self-instruction mode, allowing the user to learn by doing.
