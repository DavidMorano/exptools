Icon is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that 
contains many features for processing nonnumeric data, particularly
for textual material consisting of strings of characters.  Icon was
designed to aid in analyzing natural languages, reformatting data,
transforming computer programs, generating computer programs, 
manipulating formaulas, formatting documents, and so forth.  IT
is suited to situations where a quick solution is needed, one
that can be obtained with a minimum of time and programming effort.
Icon is extremely useful for 'one-shot' programs and for 
speculative efforts such as computer-generated poetry, in which a
proposed problem solution is more heuristic than algorithmic.

Icon is a high level programming language designed for string processing
and other non-numeric applications (numeric processing can be done, but the
language and implementation are not tuned for it). Goal-directed evaluation
with control backtracking is an integral part of the language. However,
Icon is very different from other languages, such as Prolog, which use
this evaluation scheme. Icon has a rich set of control structures which
use and control backtracking. Most of these control structures look and
act very much like the control structures of more traditional languages,
allowing Pascal-like programming where the full power of goal-directed
evaluation is not required. Icon incorporates generators as a natural feature
within this goal-directed evaluation scheme.

Icon has a flexible run-time type system: variables may take on values of
any type and automatic type conversions are performed as needed by
operations. There are a variety of types including strings, sets, associative
tables, and lists with positional, queue, and stack access methods. All
storage management is automatic; garbage collection is performed as needed.

Icon is available for free, since it was written with support of the NSF.
Icon was originally written by Ralph Griswold, (an ex AT&T Bell Laboratories
employee) and a cast of thousands at the University of Arizona.  Ralph
Griswold, you may remember, was part of the team that developed the SNOBOL
series of languages.

Ports of Icon are available for most Unix machines, as well
as MS-DOS, VMS, and Macintosh.

Icon is not a GUI-based language. The name Icon was affixed to the language
before the usage of the term icon to mean a pictograph became popular.
