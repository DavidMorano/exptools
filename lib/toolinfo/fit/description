Fit is a general-purpose, interpreted programming language as powerful
as C and C++, yet as easy to use as Awk and shell.  Fit's interactive
interpreter/debugger makes writing and debugging programs easier and
faster.  Multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented
programming makes Fit unusually flexible.  Fit is good for text
processing, data analysis, one-shot programs, and rapid prototyping.
A fast-start primer and a complete tutorial/reference manual are available.
