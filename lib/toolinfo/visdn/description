Visdn is a 630/730 terminal mouse-oriented interface to the AT&T 7506 ISDN
telephone.  It allows the 630/730 terminal to augment the functionality of
the 7506 set with unlimited speed calling lists, programmable function
keys, and an interface to electronic mail on the UNIX host.  The ISDN set
must have Feature Package 3 (FP3) installed to use this program.
