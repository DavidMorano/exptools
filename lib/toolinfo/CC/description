The C++ Experimental Tool distribution contains the AT&T C++ translator, its
header files and libraries, and all other administrative software necessary
to develop C++ programs on your machine. C++ is a widely used extension of
the C language that supports ANSI C constructs, data abstraction, and
object-oriented programming.  Its code is efficient and portable.  The
version distributed in Experimental Tools will closely track, and in some
cases slightly lead, the officially available external release of the AT&T
C++ translator.

This tool may also be provided on your machine by your local computer
center, and you may want to check with them before populating your local
Experimental Tools directory with a duplicate of this software.  Please
refer all questions to the tool provider.
