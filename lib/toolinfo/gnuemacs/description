There is no way to describe here all the features available in GNU
Emacs.  As its source code is freely available many people have
contributed modes and packages that run on it which have eventually
been accepted into the official distribution.  A few that come to mind
are its modes for emulating other editors (vi, VMS's EDT, Gosling's
Emacs (exptools' "gmacs"), even Warren Montgomery's Emacs (exptools'
"emacs").  It has X-windows, netnews reading and mail support, an
on-board psychologist, numbered backup files, "directory editor",
shell windows, compilation in one window - go to error line in another
-- no fancy terminal needed, a tree structured documentation browsing
system ... GNU Emacs is the most popular version of emacs (see USENET
newsgroups comp.emacs, gnu.emacs.*, comp.editors, etc.) worldwide.  It
is a standard outside Bell Labs.  There is a 300 page paper and
on-line manual.
