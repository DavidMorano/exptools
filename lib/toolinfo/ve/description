The SCCS/ECMS version environment (ve) provides a single command interface
to activities with Source Code Control System (SCCS) maintained files,
especially in the context of the Extended Change Management System
(ECMS).  For ECMS users who have not previously used ve, it is an
alternative to edget, sget, vi or emacs, and edput.  Additionally, ve
provides an interface to many other ECMS operations, including unedget,
unedput, and report.  Features of ve also provide alternatives to
activities that normally would require cmspr and query.  Similar
capabilites are available for SCCS users not in an ECMS environment.
