MetaPost is a graphics language for technical illustrations in TeX or troff
documents.  The language is based on D. E. Knuth's METAFONT font-design
language, but it produces PostScript output and includes features for
integrating text and graphics.  Text typeset by TeX or troff can be included
in an illustration an manipulated as a first-class object.

The languge interpreter called `mp' processes an input file and outputs
PostScript files, one for each illustration.

The MetaPost language was created and implemented by John Hobby research!hobby
