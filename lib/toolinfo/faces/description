The faces directory contains the bitmap icons for use with xvismail and
other dmd/630/730 terminal applications.  Icons may be created by a
variety of methods, most often by free-hand drawings with the icon tool.
While in layers on a DMD terminal, type

	icon -x 48 -y 48

and use the mouse buttons to draw a picture.  After saving the picture
in a file, it may be sent to the provider of faces to be installed in
the faces directory.
