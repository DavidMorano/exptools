The text processing system TeX, along with LaTeX and other related programs,
are available in exptools.  The most comprehensive manual for TeX is "The
TeXbook" by Donald E. Knuth.  The manual for LaTeX is "The LaTeX Document
Preparation System" by Leslie Lamport. === From the LaTeX manual: "TeX is a
sophisticated program designed to produce high-quality typesetting, especially
for mathematical text.  LaTeX adds to TeX a collection of commands that
simplify typesetting by letting the user concentrate on the structure of the
text rather than on formatting commands." === Use the command "toolman tex" as
the next step in learning the multitude of features of TeX and LaTeX, available
AT&T document styles, etc.  The toolman page also refers the user to a exptools
TeX "tips" directory.  [La]TeX is supported by the "docsubmit" exptool for
submission of documents to the AT&T Library Network's Internal Technical
Document Service.  === PostScript is the output and can be input too.  The TeX
package is comprised of freely available software, and is the 2nd largest
exptool!  [2/1991, Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM & Mark_A_Hartman@ATT.COM]
