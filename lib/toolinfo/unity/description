UNITY is a small relational database management system which works with
normal UNIX files.  It allows a variety of operations on tables including
selection and projection (both formatted and unformatted), joins, and some
basic statistical analysis.  Each different operation is provided through a
different shell command.  There is also a C-level interface to UNITY which
allows C programs to have access to the same operations as the shell level.

For more information on UNITY, do "toolman Intro" after including
$TOOLS/lib/unity/bin in your PATH variable.
