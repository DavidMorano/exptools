CClib is a collection of general purpose, source-code C++ class libraries.
To avoid confusion, these libraries are NOT the libraries that are
distributed by LC with the AT&T C++ translator: rather, they are ADDITIONAL
libraries donated by members of AT&T, many of them highly regarded in the
C++ community. 

Currently, CClib includes 21 libraries that address problems ranging from
arithmetic (extensible integers and reals) to task processing (for the
Sparc), and many others as well.  Although there is no explicit or implicit
guaranteed level of support for any given library (all support decisions are
at the option of the library author), in practice most authors are
responsive to users.

Any member of AT&T owning a C++ library that they think might be of general
interest and that they wish to share is encouraged to contribute to CClib.
