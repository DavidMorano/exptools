Emacs is a full screen editor, with many features to improve your
productivity: 

	"Modeless" editing, in which text can be added or edited
	without shifting modes
	
	Ability to update up to 12 files concurrently.
	
	Ability to display 2 files at the same time.
	
	Ability to easily edit tables, "typewriter art", and other
		fixed format information.
		
	Extensive macro facility that can be used to develop
		customized editing commands and to customize the
		behavior of emacs to your liking.
		
	Support for mouse cut and paste and menus on suitable
		terminals/window environments
		
	Extensive library of macros for many situations, including
		spelling checking, news and mail reading,
		emulation of other editors, programming support,
		and technical writing support.
		
Emacs is simpler and less resource intensive than the other 2
emacs family editors available through exptools (gnuemacs, gmacs),
but lacks some of the advanced features of the other 2. A
compatible version of emacs for DOS machines is also available
from the provider.
