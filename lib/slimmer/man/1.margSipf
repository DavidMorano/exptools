          MMMMaaaarrrrggggSSSSiiiippppffff is the main slimmer tool for updating an existing
          slimmer database.  The database is located in the directory
          _D_B_P_A_T_H, with most files having the prefix _D_B_N_A_M_E. It takes
          raw input starting with a .new line (indicating a new
          record), followed by designator/value information for the
          record.  If no control number is given on the .new line,
          then a new record is created with the next available control
          number for the database.  If a control number is given, then
          either a new record is created with the indicated number, or
          the new data is merged into the existing record.  This merge
          is done so that existing fields are thrown out and the new
          data is used.

          The .new line can also contain a search statement, starting
          with an open parenthesis.  The software does the indicated
          search to determine which record is being worked on.  This
          feature is handy for databases with unique fields which are
          NOT the actual slimmer record keys.  If the search retrieves
          more than 1 record, then the record update is skipped.  If
          the search retrieves zero items, the record is skipped
          unless the .new line ended with a <tab><control number>.  In
          this case the indicated control number is used.  Note that
          if the control number is zero, then a new record key is
          assigned.

          There are a variety of options to control how _m_a_r_g_S_i_p_f
          operates:

               ----iiii <<<<FFFFiiiilllleeee nnnnaaaammmmeeee>>>>
                    This tells the command to take its data from the
                    indicated file rather than stdin.

               ----ssss   This tells the command to be silent on certain
                    type of problems.  Presently this is if a field is
                    being added and it is: a flag with content; or a
                    string with no content.

               ----AAAA   Leave the data fields in the order they arrive.
                    By default, they are arranged by the field numbers
                    given in the designator table.

               ----FFFF   This causes all terms from the new record to be
                    added into the index.  Normally this is not
                    desirable, since if you are merging into an
                    existing record many terms will already be in the

                    index.  However, if two indeces are being
                    maintained to one database, then it is necessary
                    to use this option.

               ----NNNN   For long fields, slimmer usually keeps the field
                    as a single string with no new lines.  This way,
                    the display can be made depend on the width of the
                    output media.  However, for some data, the
                    placement of the new lines is important.  This
                    switch says to leave new lines where they are in
                    the incoming data.

               ----OOOO   This tells the system to overwrite existing
                    records with the incoming data.  That is, instead
                    of merging records, the new data replaces existing
                    records.

               ----SSSS <<<<nnnnuuuummmmbbbbeeeerrrr>>>>
                    This switch tells the starting control number to
                    assign new records that are created.

               ----XXXX   This switch tells the command to NOT write the
                    record.  That is, only the index is updated.

               ----YYYY   This switch says only update the record, not the
                    index.  This is generally a bad idea since it puts
                    the index and and database out of sync.

          To delete a record using _m_a_r_g_S_i_p_f give it just a .new while
          using the overwrite flag (-O).  This causes it to overwrite
          the existing record with an empty record, which is
          interpreted as a delete.

          To delete a field depends on the type of field.  To delete a
          string or count field, simply give the field designator with
          no data.  To delete a flag field, give the flag designator
          with data.  For example to delete the "flag" field, give the
          input
                                  .flag delete
