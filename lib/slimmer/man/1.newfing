          The nnnneeeewwwwffffiiiinnnngggg command build the index or finger file of an
          iolib database.  Usually it is not invoked directly, but
          rather through the slimmer command
                                  build-db -f
          and usually the FINGname will be DBNAME.fing.  NNNNeeeewwwwffffiiiinnnngggg build
          up a list of all key / location pairs in memory (this
          information is what is stored in the finger file).  These
          are sorted only if they are not in order to start.

          The parameters are not often used, and serve very special
          purposes:

               ----vvvv   Makes the command run verbose; this causes it to
                    put out usually uninteresting additional
                    information on how it is doing.

               ----ssss <<<<nnnnuuuummmmbbbbeeeerrrr>>>>
                    This is the number of empty slots to leave per
                    block for growth.  Note that a block will simply
                    overflow once it exceeds the number of empty
                    slots.

               ----LLLL   For very large databases all key/location pairs
                    cannot be collected in main memory.  If a realloc
                    to grow this space fails, _n_e_w_f_i_n_g dumps the pairs
                    to a temporary file to use in place of memory.
                    However, this means the process has grown very
                    large, with space it has freed.  The -L flag tells
                    it at start to use a temporary file, not memory.
                    Note large is relative - this feature has been
                    only been utilized on databases with over two
                    million records, and even then on machines with
                    (by present standards) small amounts of memory.

          The command will often put out a message of the form
                       9452 carcasses taking 9332488 space
          This message indicates how much wasted space is in the
          database that would be recovered by a garbage collection
          (using command conv_slim).
