You can indicate that you want all records with a given term removed
from your retrieved set. This is done by putting a minus sign (-) in
front of the term to be removed. For example, entering  "-computer"
removes records with the term "computer" from your retrieved set. The
search       "retriev? -dog -canine?"       finds all records with
a term starting with "retriev" removing those with the term "dog" or
a term starting with "canine".
