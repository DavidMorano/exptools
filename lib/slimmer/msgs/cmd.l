The limit command (which can be shortened to l) is used to limit
a set by its control or accession numbers. Note that this makes the
command very database dependent. So this message should include
database information describing available limits.
  As an example, say the the database administrator has set up a
limit called "84" since all 84 documents occur together in the
database. To limit set 3 to "84" use the command:
     limit s3/84     or      l 3/84

which will create a new set.
