A database consists of a number of fields. The best way to find out the
fields of this database and their content is to contact someone knowledgeable
about the database.  A cruder, alternative approach is to look at a record
with the "s" format.  E.g.    d1/s/1.
   At the start of each field displayed is its specific field designator.
