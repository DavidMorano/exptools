You are in the command system. This interface is for experienced users
and gives a minimum of assistance. It may be helpful to note that this
interface resembles that of major vendors (Dialog, BRS, SDC, etc) quite
closely.
   There are a variety of types of help available. A good starting point is
	    ? cmds   which will give a list of commands.

Note that help on a given command is obtainable by 
      ? <command name>       or         <command name> ?
