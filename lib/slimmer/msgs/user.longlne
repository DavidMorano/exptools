The line you are presently entering is going to be broken up into
words to use in an automatic search. The system will require all
retrieved documents to have ALL the words you have entered. So
usually just a few words are sufficient to restrict a search to a given
item or subject.
  If you really need to be more specific, you will be given the chance
later. So the best strategy at this point is to back space to the last
word boundary and do a return to see what the system will retrieve with
what you have given.
