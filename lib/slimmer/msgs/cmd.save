The save command allows you to save all the commands you have used
during a given slimsrch session. It saves one command per line with
the line preceded by a tab (note this tab does not affect later exec'ing
of this file). The file is saved by default in the UNIX system directory
     $HOME/slimmer.
If this is not possible (e.g. the directory does not exist) then the
file is saved in the current directory.  However, if the save file name
contains a slash it is assumed relative to the present directory.
  To save the commands up to the present point use the command:
	save filename
