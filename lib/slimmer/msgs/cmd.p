The print command (which can be abbreviated to p) works exactly
like the display command except the output is sent to the printer.

It works by using standard terminal "media on" and "media off" commands.
These command turn on displays to the printer while turning off displays
to the screen.  Note that if your terminal does not support these
features the print feature will NOT work on your terminal.

For example, to print items from set 3 use the command

   print 3/b/1-3   or   p3/f/1,5,7
