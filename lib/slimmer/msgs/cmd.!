The exclamation mark (!) allows you to escape to the shell to execute
UNIX system commands. It is restricted in that the command given
cannot contain slashes.  This is done for security reasons since
users may be using slimsrch from a login other than their own.
  The system puts the control number (key) of the last displayed
record in the UNIX environment variable SLIMCNTL.

Examples:
      !date
      ! quicksrch !${SLIMCNTL} | mailx mhuxd!wald
