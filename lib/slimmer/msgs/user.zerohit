Several general methods can be used to help find the desired items/subjects:
  - Use only author's last names (e.g. "smith", for "smith ee").
  - Use truncation (e.g.  inform? will find all terms starting with inform).
  - Use synonyms  (e.g. youth, children, adolescen?)
  - Use broad terms (e.g. astronomy in place of cosmology)
