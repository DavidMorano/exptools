The exec command allows you to execute a file consisting of command lines
for the command mode of slimsrch.  Each line is taken as a command, exactly
as though it was typed in.  One caution is that set references (e.g. S3, S9)
will not be the same if you have already done some searches.
  The file to execute is looked for first in the present directory and then
in the directory HOME/slimmer.  To execute a file the command is:
	 exec filename
