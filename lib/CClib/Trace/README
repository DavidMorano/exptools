This Execution Trace Facility package consists of a library (trace.a) 
for target programs and a controller (tracer). It was originally 
created for a production project. Due to its possibility for generic 
use, it has been repackaged to form this version. It has been 
successfully compiled and executed for this environment:

    Machine: 3b2/600
    Unix Version: SVR3
    C++ Cfront: 2.0

Before you do anything, look at the makefile to see if there is any
make variables you want to adjust. Basically, you would want to
put the library in some visible area where any program can be linked
to and the controller to some visible 'bin'.

I believe that the only dependencies this package has on any UNIX 
machine is the Cfront version and probably location and names of 
system header files (e.g. types.h ). So it should compile and work
on most UNIX machines with little modifications.

After you have successfully compiled the package. Try the test program
'tr_test' by do the followings:
    make the test program: 'make test'
    turn the trace on: 'tracer'
    run the test: 'tr_test 6'
    check the trace output (in the file you specify in tracer)
    have fun!
