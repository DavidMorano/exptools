This version of enum is compatible with the 2.0 version of C++.
It currently runs on an HP 850 under HP-UX (HP's version of the
UNIX(R) operating system).

Enum is generated with stage using nmake.

Enum was conceived and produced by Mitch Bass.  Mitch has since
left the Company.  It has been modified by Dennis Mancl and myself
since Mitch has left. We have found this code useful and I offer it for use.
Please let me know if you have extensions or have found bugs.
I am interested in this code's evolution and plan to keep a
"latest and greatest" version.  Contact me at:
