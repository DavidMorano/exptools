This is version 1.2 of the Vec library.  There are two sets of 
sources and makefiles.  Those prefixed with 'em_' are for the 
emulation library; those prefixed with 'fx_' are for the Alliant
library.

Two additional files, vectorops.h and veclib.h are provided 
which define the C++ interface to the Alliant vector processor.

The fcxvec class uses a version of the complex library that has
been modified for single precision instead of double.  However, 
since this library is not yet generally available, the makefiles
define scomplex to be complex resulting in fcxvec being identical
to dcxvec.  If the scomplex library is available the makefile can
be modified by removing the define.

To make the library rename either fx_makefile or em_makefile to
'makefile' and type 'make'.  libVec.a can then be copied to 
the library directory in which libC.a resides and the manual
page, Vec.3C++, can be copied to you man directory.  The .h 
files should be copied into /usr/include/CC.
