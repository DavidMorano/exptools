	make -f exact.mk 

will make the library real.a.

To install real.a and real.h in /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/include
respectively do

	make -f exact.mk LOCAL=/usr/local install

xmakefile is a makefile for use with the latest (experimental) version
of nmake. exact.mk is generated automatically from it (which accounts
for its peculiar style.)

Hardcopy versions of some reference material is available from
