Abstract:

	PANELFEATURES is a library of C++ classes describing generic knob
  and display atoms and associated operations which can be combined to
  construct stimulus driven state machine models in software for any
  application which gains benefit from an interactive graphical interface
  presented in the form of a control panel.

	The package provides a set of tools which hide from the programmer
  the low level user interface details such as graphics representations,
  range checking, default values, panel layout, and window management
  for arbitrary applications.  In addition to the interface facilities, the
  package provides a methodology for decomposing the application into a 
  hierarchical tree structure and for creating re-usable modules which
  can be recombined to form new applications.  The above memo describes
  the details for each of the defined object classes and provides manual
  pages along with a description of a sample application (the demo program
  which is supplied in this directory).

	The software is mostly written in C++ with the exception of the
  graphics drivers which are downloaded to the AT&T 630 MTG terminal.  For
  those who don't have a 630 MTG terminal, a curses interface package is 
  provided.  Tools needed to build this software are the C++ compiler
  and optionally, the 630 MTG software development tools.
