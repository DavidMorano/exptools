************************************************
     This package was developed in 1987 on a pre-C++2.0 compiler
  using the standard make facilities.  The package contained in this
  library may not compile and load with your current tools.  The
  developing organization has since converted the package to C++2.0
  and now uses Nmake2.0 to build the libraries.  The upgraded package
  also has many new features and is still actively supported for work
  in that organization.

  There are no plans currently to release the upgraded software for
  widespread distribution via public facilities such as this library.
  However, support and distribution of this enhanced package may be
  negotiable on a case by case basis for those with justified business
  needs.  The responsible project supervisor for the Panelfeatures
  package is:

         Orlando Sotomayor-Diaz   (908)957-2665   probe!osd

  Technical questions and issues should be forwarded to:

         Jim Iorio (908)957-2672   probe!jdi

ALSO, NOTE ON ACCESS TO PANELFEATURES MAN PAGE UNDER EXPTOOLS:
	use 'toolman panelfeature' instead of 'toolman panelfeatures', due
	to a truncation of the name to 14 chars
