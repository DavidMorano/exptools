.br
The \fBwgets()\fP function reads through a window into a string.
It has several features not found in the curses wgetstr routine.
.BL
.LI
The length of the string is passed as an argument.  If the user types
more than length minus 1 characters wgets will beep and refuse to accept
each new character until a terminating character is received.
Length should be less than or equal to the size of memory pointed to by string
(e.g. if string is a character array of 20 bytes, length should be 20).
.LI
Wgets has one or more characters for each of the following functions:
erase character, erase field, save (done with record), quit (done with input)
next (next field in record) and previous (previous field in record).
The erase character and erase field functions are used for editing,
the others are
terminating functions.  When a character specifying one of the terminating
functions is received,
wgets returns the value of that character.  The sets of
characters and matching case clauses are defined in wgets.h.
The interpretation of the terminating functions is left to the
application code but the intended interpretation is defined above.
.LI
The \fBinit_screen()\fP, \fBsetLabels()\fP and \fBclear_labels()\fP functions
may be used to provide soft labels.  The \fBset_labels()\fP
function calls \fBsetLabels()\fP with function key designations that agree
with the wgets interpretation.  The \fBset_menu_labels()\fP function calls
\fBsetLabels()\fP with function key designations that are consistent with
\*(Mn.  The \fBinit_screen()\fP function is called instead of initscr().
In addition to the initscr() functionality it sets up soft labels and puts
curses in a state where calls to wgetch(3X) are in character-at-a-time
no-echo mode while calls to \*(Wg are in line-at-a-time echo mode.
The \fBset_labels()\fP function should be called before \fBwgets()\fP to
display the soft labels.  The \fBclear_labels()\fP function should be
called when finished to erase the soft labels.
.LE
.LI "\fBDIAGNOSTICS\fP"
.br
The \*(Wg functions print know error messages.  Their behavior is that
of the underlying curses(3X) library.
