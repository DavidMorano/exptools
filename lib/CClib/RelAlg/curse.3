Curse - base class for classes using curses(3X)

.LI "\fBDESCRIPTION\fP"
.SP
The Curse class provides a base class for deriving other curses(3X) related
classes.  The first construction of a Curse object calls the curses function
initscr() while the last destruction calls the curses function endwin().
The Curse class also calls endwin() whenever any signal whose default setting
is termination is detected while a Curse object is active.  If a trap function
existed prior to the first Curse construction, the detected signal will be
cascaded to it.  If this prior trap returns without exiting, the Curse trap
function will call initscr() again.
.P
If you use classes derived from Curse you don't generally need to define a
base Curse object.  However, if you call a curses function prior to constructing
the first derived class object, for example as an argument to the derived class
constructor, you should define a Curse prior to that function call so that it
will behave properly.  A base Curse object can also be used for curses programs
without any derived objects.  In that case it provides a simple means for
entering and exiting curses and it protects against signals.

If Curse traps a signal and the previous setting is SIG_DFL, Curse
prints the message "Signal <number> received." to standard error
and exits using the signal number as the exit status.
.LI "\fBWARNINGS\fP
.br
If new signal traps are set after the Curse object is declared, the application
must take responsibility for saving the trap function address returned from
signal(2) or sigset(2), and invoking that trap function from within the new 
trap function.
