.br
The Santa Barbara Library (sblib) is a set of miscellaneous C++ classes and
functions developed at AT&T Santa Barbara Laboratory.  The sblib includes
functions and classes for file handling, error handling, regular
expressions, screen management and simple list containers.
.P
The basename, dirname and create_file functions, as well as the Vfd and
Vfile classes, are used for file handling.  The basename and dirname
functions parse a UNIX pathname into its directory entry component and
directory path component, respectively.  The create_file function creates
a file in the UNIX file hierarchy.  Unlike the creat(2) system call, it
does not leave an open file descriptor.  The Vfd and Vfile classes provide
caching of open files to provide apparently unlimited open files.  The
Vfd class provides a system I/O (file descriptor) interface while the Vfile
class provides a standard I/O (FILE pointer) interface.
.P
The upper and lower functions are used for string handling.  They return
a copy of a string translated to upper or lower case, respectively.
.P
The Error class provides a uniform interface for error handling.  Although
it does not behave identically to System V Release 4 error handling, it
provides roughly the same appearance and features and is intended to ease
the transition to System V Release 4.
.P
The Form class provides automatically generated forms for input, update and
display with a built-in look and feel.  The forms are based on the curses
library, but pre-date FMLI and the Character User Interface Style Guide.
.P
The List classes provide simple containers with list, stack or queue
behavior.
The Pattern class encapsulates the interface to the regcmp/regex functions,
which provide regular expression pattern matching.
.LI "\fBDEFINITIONS\fP"
.br
The sblib has several typedefs.  Addr_t is similar to the system's caddr_t
and is used for addresses.  Float_t and Int_t provide consistent treatment
of floating point and integer data.  Boolean_t and its two constants, TRUE
and FALSE, provide for boolean values.  These typedefs exist in part to
provide compatibility with the relational algebra library.
.P
The sblib also #defines several cpp(1) constants.  EMPTY_STRING is a string
containing an immediate NULL character.  PARENT, CHILD and FORKERR are
defined to make it convenient to switch on the fork(2) system call.  The
max() macro takes the greater of two objects.  The strNcpy() macro works
like strncpy(3) but ensures that the result is NULL terminated.
.P
The error(3SB) and wgets(3SB) manual pages describe additional sblib
definitions
.LI "\fBFILES\fP"

.DS
LDIR and INCLUDE are specified during installation.

INCLUDE/sblib.h - declarations for the sblib classes and functions.
LDIR/libsblib.a - definition for the sblib classes and functions.
.DE
.LI "\fBDIAGNOSTICS\fP
.br
Functions and classes in the sblib use the syserr, formerr, listerr
or ptrn_err Error objects.  Some functions, particularly those compiled
with the C compiler, may use perror(3) or the sys_errlist[].
.LI "\fBWARNINGS\fP
.sp
Some of the functions and classes in the sblib library require linkage to
system libraries, including libcurses.a and libPW.a.  Use of libmalloc.a
is recommended since occasional problems have occurred with the libc.a version
of malloc.
