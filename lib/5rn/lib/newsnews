*** NEWS NEWS ***

5rn has been updated to the latest version of rn (Version 4.4, patchlevel 3).
Also, the program has been modified so that it recognizes the new NFS
storage of the news archives (so followup should work correctly now).

Please let me know if you have any problems with this updated version of 5rn.
