A dictionary of frequently used AT&T acronyms is now available in
the "lib" subdirectory of tts ($TOOLS/lib/tts).
The file is called "EMailDictionaryMT."
It is used to "teach" tts how to pronounce certain acronynms,
before the text to be spoken is piped through.
This particular dictionary was used in reading e-mail.

This dictionary was developed by Rich Pennenga of AT&T Bell Labs
in Middletown, and I have included it here in exptools,
in its entirety, with his permission (indeed, at his suggestion).

If you have dictionaries of your own that you'd like to submit,
or if you have suggestions for how to improve this one,
please contact the tts provider.

SPECIAL NOTE: A VERY specific special-case bug has been located in TTS.
Specifically, it can't pronounce (without help from the user)
any acronym ending in "A".
Both the man page and the SampleText have been updated to explain
this known bug (and how to work around it).
