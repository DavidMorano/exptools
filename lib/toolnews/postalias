toolnews: postalias -
=====================

version 3.1b (9/12/95):

   - Works with Sendmail/EMS-aliases on SUNs:
        - display, search, expand, and edit capabilities
        - install/delete requests sent to local administrator
        - converts "Src" aliases to "email-format" for better performance
        - assumes all public alias files are in the same directory
        - /opt/mail/lib/include is the default directory
        - PA_ALIASTYPE & PA_LISTDIR can be set to override defaults

   - Relaxed syntax of alias source:
        - Continuation backslash is optional, not required
        - Alias name is not required as first line of alias

   - Detects more aliases in .mailrc file
