				gspell and grope
				================

New news:

    gspell
	I'm embarrassed; the gspell manual page and usage string both
	indicate that it will support a "-l dictionary" option, but
	the code did not. Sigh. It does now.

Description:

New commands for those of us who can't spell, even after 'spell'
tells us that the word is spelled incorrectly.

Commands are 'gspell' and 'grope', which reside in $TOOLS/bin.

Not to be out done by "grep", grope allows the user to "grope" around a
dictionary for misspelled words. The effort is a simple application for Rick
Boivie's creative algorithm that globally searches for an "irregular"
expression. Grope will search for each of the words given on the command
line, and then prompt on standard input for additional search words. If just
a carriage return is typed, the next best entry will be returned for each
carriage return. To quit, enter "q" or type a control-D.

Gspell, given a filename, runs spell on the file and returns the misspelled
words followed by their dictionary look-up.

Man pages are available via toolman.
