Dear vi- and emacsterm users,

There was something wrong in the last updated version for emacsterm, it was
not loading the correct emacsterm.m or viterm.m file. I have installed the
corrected version today on your local machine. I hope this will solve the 
problems.

Previous new item

This news item tells that the this week announced emacs(vi-)term is installed
on your system. It incorporates the changes listed below. It also run in
non-layer mode. If you find any bugs using this package, please report to me,
I will try to find out what is wrong.

===============

Gregg Wonderly did help me with updating the package to support 730windows,
while Dave Dykstra gave some hints on support of the package while not running
layers. The package is now able to run without layers environment setup and
will use 730windows support whenever this is installed. I will send the
update to exptools in 2 days. Other fixes to come:

- emacs does not support correctly the repeating arrow function (scrolling the
  file using the scrollbar)

- send/save escape sequence to save the highlighted region into the global
  region

If you have any problems/suggestions please let me know.

regards Michiel Los
