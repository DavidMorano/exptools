DESCRIPTION:

	For those of you who may not be familiar with 'log',
	here is a brief description.
	
	log provides the ability to record your terminal session
	to a file by invoking the hrdcpy command.
	
	log does not replace hrdcpy. Instead, log provides a
	conveient way to do the following things.
	
	  - You invoke log by entering log xxxxx (xxxxx is any
	    string identifier; example: log junk).
	    (xxxxx is equivalent to the filename on hrdcpy).
	
	  - The ouput is stored in a fixed directory (optionally
	    controlled by the LOGDIR exported variable).
	
	  - You can read the hrdcpy file by simply typing loge.
	
	In addition:
	
	1. You may add notes to your hrdcpy file via logn.
	2. You can append 5ESS asserts to your hrdcpy file by
	   issuing loga.
	3. You can clear your hrdcpy file without exiting
	   hrdcpy.
	4. You may have multiple 'log' commands running at same time.
	5. Plus more....
	6. To get a mini-manual page just issue log with no
	   arguments
	7. To get a complete manual page (with lots of examples)
	   issue: toolman log.
