exmmx toolnews 11 Feb 1994


The exmmx tool is documented to work with Xerox 9700-type printers.
The Indian Hill facilities have recently eliminated this type of printer
in favor of PostScript printers.  The exmmx tool has not been converted
to work with PostScript printers.

A Xerox-to-PostScript conversion program has been made available for
the PostScript printers at the Indian Hill locations, but this tool
is not compatible with that facility.  Any customers at the Indian
Hill facilties who are using exmmx should switch to other printing
tools that are compatible with PostScript printers.

If someone is interested in doing the conversion for exmmx to work with
PostScript printers, send mail to att!exptools.
