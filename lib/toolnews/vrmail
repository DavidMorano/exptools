====  NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE ====

Vrmail was accidently deleted from all exptools machines last week.
It has been rebuilt from scratch and redistributed.  If you are
still unable to access vrmail, please let me know so that I can
get the administrators to help me get distributions accelerated.

Sorry for the inconvience for those who find the tool useful...

====  NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE NOTICE ====

Hopefully, this is the last update to vrmail for a while.  If you
are still having problems with something, please let me know so
that I can look into it.

o	Fixed problem with FACEPATH=!cmd handling where the subject line
	was not being included as expected.
o	Worked around problem with i486 and mips (really all SVR4) not
	deleting window when you hit return.
o	Changed time to just include hours and minutes.
o	Change date to use abbreviated strings.
o	Further corrected values calculated for date and time positioning.

=== old news =======================================================

This is the fourth update in the past week.  There where a couple
of problems that I tried to solve quickly.  These were

o	hdrexp was not sent out
o	lib/vrmail/host had a bug in it for forw, repl and comp
o	It did not work on 630's
o	The mouse cursor flashed wildly due to a call to request() in a loop.
o	The subject portion of the command line for !facepath handling was
	actually the from information repeated.
o	The date flashed every second.  It should now update at the same
	interval used for looking for new mail (40 seconds by default).
o	The i486 version was not compiled with -Bstatic which resulted in
	references to libraries which not everyone would have...

Hopefully these things are now fixed...

=== old old news ====================================================

Vrmail has been updated.  The changes are itemized below.
It has been quite a while since vrmail was updated, so there
might be some things different that I forgot to document here.

I have tried to provide some remedial locking which should help
eliminate truncated mail boxes when you try to print/read several
messages, one after the other.  From time to time, this locking
might become confused and result in a message asking if you want
to ignore a lock.  In most cases, it is safe to do so, but make
sure that you know nothing else is going on.  Post/mailx has
a fundamental problem with locking mail files and will not lock
a file that is loaded with "post -f file".  This results in
truncated mail files because one version of post is reading
while another is writing and will get a shortened version of
the mail file that it will then write back out.

Added a simple facility for allowing the menu to include text
from another file so that the folder list can be dynamically
created without creating the whole menu in a script.

Change all operations in the host script which used to use
post/mailx -f ${VM_MAILFILE} to instead set MAIL=${VM_MAILFILE}
and then not use the -f.  The -f option does not perform locking
and the result can be a trashed mailbox if you tried to do many
things to your mailbox at once.  The result will be that you
might see messages about "this instance of ... is read only".
This will mean that sometimes the "read" status may not be updated
correctly.  But, with post/mailx there does not seem to be any other
way to guarantee that the mailbox will not get trashed.

Fixed a problem with reply not performing 'o' command correctly.
Setting VM_OUTBOX= and not using 'o' explicitly still worked.

Added support for header rewrites to get the To: and Cc:
lines to be correct after post lookups and aliases.

Add support for 730windows control of the window.

A box (narrow, but visible) is placed around faces cooresponding
to mail messages that your login name does NOT appear in the To:
list (i.e. message was probably Cc'd to you).

When multiple windows are opened, they are now stacked diagonally
down the screen to aid in sorting through them.

Fixed a bug with login to face mapping which was limiting the
login to the first 10 characters.  since the host name is at the
beginning of this string, only 3 or so characters of the login
were used to map to faces.  Thus, ken would match kent etc.

Added support to use the new libwindows code from Dave Dykstra.
This should allow vrmail to work under pseudo-tty layers as
he has implmented and made available as a product from NCR.
There is a similar version available from USTOP.
