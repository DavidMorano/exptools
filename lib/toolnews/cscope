Version 13.6

A new option has been added to cscope: -a

This enhances the "Find this egrep pattern:" searches by using a
secondary prompt to get a regular expression describing the subset of
files to search.  Useful in large systems with thousands of files.

Version 13.5

With help from Fangli Chang, the SDL parsing of cscope has been upgraded for
AT&T SDL/PR language so that reserved words are not put in the database and
definitions are now recorded correctly.

With help from Harold Bamford, the MSDOS version of cscope, for use with 
Borland C, is upgraded as follows:

-C is fixed to allow case independent searches

Viewpathing now works.

^R doesn't hang the PC any more.

New version of DOS curses so its more compatible with UNIX.

The version number of the msdos executable is not 13.5 but 13.4.1. Thus the
functionality is the same as cscope 13.4.1. I have merged the changes into
the UNIX version 13.5 for compatiblity.
