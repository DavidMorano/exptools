Subject:   Installation of 5rn version 4.4p3

5rn has been updated to the latest version of rn (Version 4.4, patchlevel 3).
Also, the program has been modified so that it recognizes the new NFS
storage of the news archives (so followup should work correctly now).

Please let me know if you have any problems with this updated version of 5rn.

Subject: Installation of 5rn tool for 5E News

The 5rn(1) exptool has been installed on this machine.  This is a version of
the popular rn(1) netnews reader adapted for use with 5E news.  In general,
it allows the news reader to zip through articles with a minimum of waiting,
and is user-configurable.

This version is exactly the same source code used on the Bell Labs news
servers in Columbus.  Only the configuration has been changed to recognize
the 5enews heirarchy.

To use 5rn(1), simply type in ~exptools/bin/5rn, or, if you have ~exptools/bin
in your PATH, just type in 5rn.  It is not necessary to set up any shell
environment variables.  Note that 5rn(1) is only available on those machines
that support 5enews.  Other machines will result in an error message indicating
that the program could not change to the ~5enews/lib/netnews/articles
directory.

See the 5rn(1) exptool manual page for more details.
