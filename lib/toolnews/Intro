		       INTRODUCTION TO EXPTOOLS

The exptools bin is a place for experimental tools (hence the name) that
are NOT officially supported.  Support is unofficially provided by people
who are willing to install and maintain these tools.  To use exptools, you
must set the TOOLS environment variable at the top of your $HOME/.profile
file as follows

	TOOLS=`logdir exptools` export TOOLS

and after this line you must put $TOOLS/bin in your PATH.  Some exptools
have become part of System V over the years, so if you want the latest
exptools version put $TOOLS/bin before the default PATH

	PATH=$TOOLS/bin:$PATH

or if you want the officially supported version put $TOOLS/bin after the
default PATH

	PATH=$PATH:$TOOLS/bin

If you use the Korn shell, you will also want to set the FPATH variable as
follows:

	FPATH=$FPATH:$TOOLS/fbin

to pick up the ksh functions provided by exptools.

For general information about exptools, use the command

	expinfo

to get a menu of topics covering a wide variety of questions often asked
about the tools.  This command can provide information directly, or will
point the user to other commands that can handle more complex queries.  Some
of these other commands are described below.

To get a list of the exptools administrators, tools, and their providers,
type

	providers

To get news about new tools or changes to tools, use the

	toolnews

command, which works just like the news command.  It's a good idea to put
the following command in your $HOME/.profile to tell you when there is new
toolnews

	toolnews -n

To print man pages, use the 'toolman <tool>' command, where <tool> is the
tool or command whose documentation is desired.  For example, to see the
complete documentation on the toolman command itself, type

	toolman toolman
