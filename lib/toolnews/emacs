Emacs 5.6e has been installed on this system.  The following list
outlines changes introduced with this version, some of which have
been previously installed.  Please report any problems to ixserve!warren

11/11/94 Change to the BASIC macro package.

Due to user complaints about the consequence of
accidentally invoking the mail processing macros (M-M), these
macros are no longer automatically loaded as part of the "basic"
package.  If you wish to continue to use this package, you must
load the macro ~EMACS/macros/mail AFTER you load the basic
package.  To make this happen automatically, either add the line
^X^L~EMACS/macros/mail after loading "basic" in your .emacs_init,
or if you do not have a .emacs_init already, copy the file
$TOOLS/lib/emacs/.emacs to $HOME/.emacs_init, and add the line
above to the end of the file. 

1/1/95 The fill command (M-") will now avoid reformatting text between
.nf and .fi, .DS and .DE, .TS, and .TE, etc.

7/15/95 -- Emacs will now automatically re-size the kill buffer
(which holds text you have picked up or deleted) if you exceed the
built in limit of 256K.  You should no longer get warnings when
trying to delete or move large blocks of text, but may get a fatal
error if the block you are moving exceeds the amount of file space
available to emacs.  When the buffer is expanded, previously
deleted text will still be lost.

7/15/95 -- a New mode, "kill_space" indicates the amount of total memory
emacs has for saving deleted text.  The space available is 1024
times the value of this mode.  Normally users should not need to
touch this mode, but reducing it may be of value if your system
frequently runs out of temporary space and increasing it may be
useful if you know you will be moving very large blocks of text.

9/15/95 -- a new macro command expand-multiple (M-2M-E) allows
you to expand file name expressions with multiple expansions
(e.g. *.c) and retrieve all the expansions (within implementation
limits of 256 characters or 16 expansions total).
