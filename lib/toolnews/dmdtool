Dmdtool has been updated to give preference to $TOOLS/bin/xdmdld over
$TOOLS/bin/dmdld.  This takes advantage of the new and improved downloader
with the larger buffer sizes.  The larger buffer size greatly improves 
performance to 730s over TCP/IP on at least i386 and sun machines when
not in layers, and on i386 machines when using network XT.

Dmdtool also now uses 'agent ROMVERSION' if it has trouble determining the
terminal type.

Dmdtool is a support tool for developers of exptools that download programs
to both 5620s and 630/730s.  If you provide a tool that supports both of
these terminal types and are not currently using dmdtool, please check it out.

Dmdtool is currently used by 730windows, iconize, xdmddemo, xhp2621, xjf,
xjx, xlens, xproof, xtdmd, xtek4014, xtwid, and xucache so if you 
notice problems downloading any of those tools, let me know.
