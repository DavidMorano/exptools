Solaris Update for Less:

The regular expression searches functionality has (finally) been fixed
for Solaris machines.  Less, on Solaris machines, will now allow you to
search using standard regular expressions as documented by the UNIX
manual pages for regex(3G).  (Solaris users can type "man -s3G regex"
to view this).
