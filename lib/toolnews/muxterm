=== Version 1.20 ===

Now performs work round the NEWLAYER(NEW) agent message
with window ID of 0.

So, all those people wanting to use "layers -f <scriptname>" command
should be able to do so!

PS:
Is there any interest in a LINUX version of Muxterm ?
Or an i486 Version ? If so, please contact keith.porteous@att.com.

Hi folks,

"muxterm" is a multiplexor system (using X-windows) to make use of
the 630/730 "layers" program, so allowing the option to have upto
seven windows connected via one serial link.

From your X-window system, you may connect to a remote system
that supports 630/730 terminals and utilize the layers
program - so preventing the need to connect to the same
host multiple times, and to make use of limited bandwidth
for remote site users.

It is useful for those in 5ESS community, as it allows the use of
the auto script for the EES, and (vttool) with the 5ESS lab's from
your workstation (If you are using a 5ESS lab, then I suggest you
set TERM=vt100 before using vttool -mcc).

If your link can support using "nlayers", then muxterm will attempt
to use a larger packet size protocol which improves muxterm's performance.

For further information, read the manual page via "toolman muxterm"
or contact one of the "muxterm" providers mentioned via
"providers muxterm".
