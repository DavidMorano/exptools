Lynx is a browser for simple text files or for HTML hypertext documents.
It can access files on the local file system, or remotely via ftp,
http, wais, gopher, or nntp.

A toolman page is available for lynx, but the most complete and
current help information can best be found on the Web by typing the
"h" command within lynx.

This exptools distribution of lynx includes modifications to enable it to
work through the AT&T firewalls and to work with the Columbus NetNews
nntp servers. 

Supported machines: sun-sparc-sunos4.1.x sun-sparc-solaris2.x
