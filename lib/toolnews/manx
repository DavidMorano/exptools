Manx has been updated.

DWB3.3 removed the recognition of -can for compacted macros.  I have changed
manx to use -man instead.

--- old news ---

For the changes below, I broke the sparc version due to an invalid reference
to page zero memory.

I also fixed a problem with manx getting confused about a manual page not
being formatted under some circumstances (the 1.ttype manual page had this
problem).
