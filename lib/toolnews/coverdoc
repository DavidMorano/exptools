UPDATE:
	Coverdoc now warns users of the existence of a temp.cover file
	in their current directory. It now requires the confirmation of
	the user in order to overwrite this file (temp.cover is the default
	output file of coverdoc). It used to overwrite without warning.
	Also, if coverdoc fails, it won't remove the temp.cover file as it
	used to. 

	The csmacros have been updated to support six-digit location codes.
	The author information section should now print correctly with the
	proper values aligned with their corresponding headings.
