vcalc 1.5.4 is being installed on all exptools SunOS/SPARC
computers.  This version contains changes to vcalc's
internal memory management necessitated by Sun's
evolving operating system.   vcalc was broken
on Suns with 4K pages.  (I use sbrk, but Sun insists 
on using malloc.)  No user visible differences should
exist.
