Due to a clash with an undocumented environmental variable used by a Sun
tool called 'tooltalk', the use of the 'ce' command's CEPATH has caused
problems for tooltalk users.  I have added a backup variable called

    CHEPATH

which can be used to control the 'ce' command's environment search to avoid
this clash.
