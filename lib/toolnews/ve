		Version Environment (ve) Release 8.1f

A new release of ve fixes a few minor bugs and significantly enhances
vi mode editing.

The enhancements to vi mode editing are:

  - Single character input and command macros are now implemented.
  - Most ex commands are now implemented, and ve can be used in a
    batch mode like ex by setting EDITOR=ex.

Other enhancements include:

  - ve now works with files under CMS 3.0, the predecessor to ECMS
    and SABLIME.
  - A new command line option, cmspr=y, allows you to produce a P.file
    with cmspr like output without having to enter the editor interactively.

Bug fixes include:

  - The hack that allows ve to work properly despite a curses/terminfo
    bug for 630, 730, and 730R2 terminals now is applied when TERM is
    730+ as well.

  - An obscure bug with automatic featuring in ECMS instances without
    isolation checking has been fixed.  An inconsistency with complex
    feature expressions has been fixed.  (These problems never occurred
    in 5ESS ECMS instances, but surfaced in some other ECMS uses.)
