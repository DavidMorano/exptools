I just made two changes to "newsview":

(1)	News directories are automatically re-loaded whenever they
	change (i.e., when a news item is added or removed).  If you
	are running newsview when an item is added to one of your news
	directories, newsview will load that item automatically, and
	you will see it by typing the 'r' command (read any unread
	news items).

	If you use a workstation with multiple windows, you can leave
	your "newsview" window running all the time, and just hit the
	'r' key once in a while to see if there is any new news to read.

(2)	On systems that can determine when a window size has changed,
	newsview will adjust its screens whenever you change the size
	of your window.  For example, if you start newsview with a 24
	line window, and you start reading a long news item and want to
	see more of it on the screen at once, you can make your window
	larger and newsview will automatically adjust to fit your screen.

If you have any trouble with "newsview", please let me know as soon as
possible.  The current version of the program is:

	NEWSVIEW Version 03/08/96 11:35:22

You can find the version by typing "newsview -V".

========================================================================

For those who are not familiar with newsview, here is a description:

Newsview is a curses-based program for reading /usr/news, and other
similar news directories (such as exptools "toolnews").  Unlike the
System V "news" command, "newsview" lets you page or scroll forward
and backward through each news item, and lets you browse through
news directories to read news items you have read before.

To read news from the default news directories, simply type "newsview".
Once newsview is running, you can type '?' for help at any time.

To read news from directories other than the default, you need to set
and export an environment variable called NEWSPATH.  This should contain
the list of news directories you want to read, with the directory names
each separated by a colon.  Here is an example (to put in your .profile):

	NEWSPATH=/usr/news:$TOOLS/lib/toolnews:/local/project/news
	export NEWSPATH

/local/project/news is an example of a directory set up for a local project.
You may have several different project news directories on your system.
Each user can decide which of these directories to read with newsview.
All people working on a given project should have write-permission in the
news directory, to allow everybody to share their items of interest.

Newsview has three types of screens:  From the Directory Menu you select
a news directory.  The File List screen displays the names of the news
items in the selected directory and lets you select a news item.  The
File Display screen displays the selected news item.

Each screen has a different set of commands available.  Press '?' at
any time to get a list of commands.  Here are a few important commands
to remember:

	r	Read the next news item that you have not yet read.
		This command is available from any screen, and is the
		quickest way to read all new news items.

	*	Print the current news item.  If you use a non-standard
		command to print ascii files, set and export the variable
		NEWSPRINT.  For example, if you want to print on a PC
		printer through "ctrm":

			NEWSPRINT=pcprint
			export NEWSPRINT

	/	Search a news directory for a string or regular expression.
		When you do a search, the list of files in your current
		news directory is limited to those files which contain
		a match to your search string.  When reading an item,
		all occurrences of the string are highlighted, and SPACE
		brings you to the next occurrence of the string.

	q	Quit the newsview program.  Your $HOME/.newsview file
		will be updated with the timestamp of the last item
		you have read in each news directory.

To list the default news directories, and the default print command
for this system type "newsview -d".  To have newsview tell you if there
are any new news items to read, type "newsview -l".  You might want to
put this command in your .profile.

For more information, type "toolman newsview".  Report problems or bugs to:
