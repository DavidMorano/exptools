			cdecl/c++decl
			=============

Version 2.14/2.9/2.6 news:
	Now understands:
		pointers to const/volatile member functions (C++)
		ellipses (...) in function parameter lists (C/C++)

	Other minor changes to flag more errors

	Changed references to the draft C standard to refer to ISO/ANSI C.

	You can now invoke cdecl/c++decl like this:

		cdecl "explain some-C-declaration"
	    or
		cdecl "declare some-declaration"
	    or
		cdecl "cast some-cast-declaration"

       NAME
	    cdecl, c++decl - Compose C and C++ type declarations

       SYNOPSIS
	    cdecl [-a |	-+ | -p	| -r] [-cidDV]
		 [[files ...] |	explain	... | declare ... | cast ... |
		 set ... | help	... | ?	... ]
	    c++decl [-a	| -+ | -p | -r]	[-cidDV]
		 [[files ...] |	explain	... | declare ... | cast ... |
		 set ... | help	... | ?	... ]

       DESCRIPTION
	    Cdecl (and c++decl ) is a program for encoding and decoding
	    C (C++) type-declarations.	The C language (the default for
	    cdecl, or with the	-a option) is based on the ANSI/ISO C
	    Standard; optionally, the C	language may be	based on the
	    pre-ANSI definition	defined	by Kernighan & Ritchie's The C
	    Programming	Language book (the -p option is	used), or the C
	    language defined by	the Ritchie PDP-11 C compiler (the -r
	    option is used).  The C++ language (the default for	c++decl,
	    or with the -+ option) is	based on Stroustrup's The C++
	    Programming	Language, plus the version 2.0 additions to the
	    language.
