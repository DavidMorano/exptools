By popular demand, tdc has now been updated to support the 1/94 version
of the GN92-600 form.  Since the format of the .GN92-600vouch file has changed,
the first time you run the program, you will be asked to remove the old file
if it is still present.  After entering the information requested, the
information will be stored in your $HOME directory in
the .GN92-600vouch file.

HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR TDC FORM:

In the past, procedures have differed for various organizations and from
time to time.  If your organization has specific procedures that are
different from those listed here, please let me know and I'll update this
information.  As far as I know, the following information applies to most
organizations using the GN92-600 form (paid through the Atlanta Payroll.)

	1) Supervisor's Signature is not required.
	2) Submit only one copy of the form
	3) Keep a copy of the form for yourself along with the associated
		bills and Universal card statements.  Keep this for 
		a period of one year.
	4) Submit the form directly to Atlanta Payroll at:	

		Telephone Reimbursement
                AT&T
                800/900 Eastside Drive
                Alpharetta, GA  30202

	        Use intra-company mail!  Do not use US Mail unless
		absolutely necessary.  I am told that most mailrooms
		will take any address that includes something close
		to "Telephone Reimbursement" and "Alpharetta, GA" and
		bundle them together for shipping.

Old News:
---------
Tdc is currently trialing a "-r" option to "redo" the last entry.  This
will reprint the form from the last entry in your .tdcrecord file.  (Typically
this would be done after editing the file to make corrections.)  The
Implementation is fairly crude and does not have any error checking to 
verify the validity of the numbers, or that the file is in the correct
format.

---------
Tdc now has a -c option to specify the number of copies of the completed
form to be printed.

---------
Thanks to Franco Barber, an electronic version of the Telephone 
Reimbursement program form (for those of us on the Atlanta Payroll) is
now available.

Tdc (also know as telerep) is a program that generates your completed 
Telephone Reimbursement Program form on a postscript printer.
You will need to print the form, get it signed, and make copies for
yourself, your supervisor, and the payroll department.
The form produced by tdc/telerep looks very much like the GN-92-600 forms 
available in the stockroom.

The first time you use tdc/telerep you will be prompted for personal 
information which will appear on each form you fill out, and which 
does not (normally) change from month to month.

See the man page for more information.

The old tdc program has been replaced and is no longer available, as the
Short Hills payroll office (which processed the forms) no longer exists.
