A bug was introduced into cgrep on some machines over the weekend.
(The SUN cluster intgp1, intgp2, etc. at IH was unaffected.)
A fix has been submitted, and should be distributed to most or all machines
tonight (Monday Oct. 11).

Since this news item was submitted with the fix, reading this
should imply that the fix has reached the machine on which you ran "toolnews".

The bug is only in version 7.05.  The corrected version is 7.06.
Type "cgrep" with no arguments to see the version number.

The symptoms of the bug is, under certain conditions, the extraneous
output of the four character string "FIVE" at the beginning of the output
to stdout.  (A diagnostic printf statement was left in the code in error).
There are no other symptoms.  The remainder of the output is correct,
and the return code is correct.

The conditions for appearance of the extraneous string are either:
1) A regular expression is used that does NOT contain a two or more
character substring of ordinary (non-meta) characters;

OR

2) The -T, -t, or +t flag is used.
