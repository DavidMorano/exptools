The 630/730 version of xcip has now been updated on this machine to include
the "move all" feature described below in the old news about the X version
of xcip.  I don't intend to update the 5620 version (does anyone out there
still use a 5620?).

------------------------------- old news -------------------------------
A couple very annoying problems with the X version of xcip have finally
been fixed on this machine.  The problems have existed ever since xcip 
was ported to X:
    1. The fonts displayed on the screen are now reasonably close to what
	is printed on the printer instead of being about 30% too small.
	I fixed this problem with some advice from Joe Davison.  Note:
	a font with point size 22 does not exist, at least on solaris 2.3,
	text of point size 22 scales down to point size 20.
    2. A "move all" feature has been added to the default button 2 operation
	to allow the user to scroll the picture around the screen.  This
	was especially needed on the X version of xcip because the screens
	(at least on Suns) have fewer pixels available top to bottom than
	a 630 and are not able to view as large of pictures as on a 630.
	Gene Bordelon gave me the idea to implement the scrolling feature
	this way.

Number 2 also applies to the 5620/630/730 versions, but I will hold off
distributing those for awhile to see if I get any feedback on the X
version.  If you notice any anomalies with placement of drawing items,
especially after having scrolled a picture, be sure to let me know.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fix I made to the fonts on the X version of xcip did not work on Sunos4
(really X11R4); it ended up choosing the default font for all fonts.  Now,
if the new improved fonts cannot be found (as on Sunos4), it goes back to
the old fonts but tries to choose a size two points larger.  It is still
not as good as on Solaris (really X11R5), and there are fewer fonts to
choose from, but it's a slight improvement.

At the same time, I made the default width of the window to be the same
number of pixels as on the 730 rather than a calculated number of inches;
the Sunos4 machine I tested it on made the window too narrow.
