forwardmail changes:

    o	A warning message has been added if sendmail exists on the system.
	sendmail doesn't follow the same forwarding conventions as other
	systems.

    o	The method of deleting forwarding has been changed to preserve any
	contents of the mailbox which may have been appended after the
	Forward to line.
