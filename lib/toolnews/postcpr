Version 3.3.1

Postcpr is enhanced to allow shading requests like postnprint. The escape
sequences needed are:

	ESC-O	Increment Shading Level
	ESC-N	Decrement Shading Level

These escape sequences are now supported by Trueprint(Exptools) when it uses 
postcpr.

OLD NEWS:
Version 3.3

Postcpr is upgraded as follows:

1) The proposed changed to look for files in DWB was not implemented as not
all sites have DWB. This leaves the existing bug that looks for ps.requests
in /usr/lib/postscript when -R is used. Since this may not exist, please use
the format -R name:0:file where file is the full path to the ps.requests
file.

2) I split postcpr.ps into two files in $TOOLS/lib/cpr. The new file forms.ps
is upgraded to fix the "outlineform" offending command problem. Forms.ps
will now only be output if the -n option uses an argument greater than 1.
Postcpr.ps is upgraded to fix the landscape printing problem (180 degrees
rotation). Your prints should now come out with holes at the top. If not,
and postnprint works ok, contact me.

3) Postcpr is upgraded to be more like postnprint. It handles font changes
easier and fixes mismatched restore commands.
