VISDN 2.8/3.1

>>>> NOTICE!!

	The post database now contains organization numbers that are
	frequently mistaken for phone numbers by the visdn software.
	There is a workaround:  Simply select the part of the post line
	that contains the phone number.  The first match algorithm will
	then find the right thing.


**** new command line argument is required: -Tpro for ProPhone,
**** 	-Tfp3 for ADM II/Feature Package 3

Latest versions:	ProPhone = 2.9/2.8
			FP3	 = 3.2/2.8
	If your screen doesn't show one of these version combinations, you
	might want to exit and reload visdn from scratch.

10/6/92 - Host version 2.8, Prophone version 2.9, FP3 version 3.2
	- Fixed logging bug, added music=RingPatternX, default ring pattern
	  is now RingPattern1 for FP3.  Fixed "pop layer to top" bug.
	  Fixed FP3 keypad reverse video bug.

visdn provides a graphical user interface on a 730 terminal to a 7506 or 7507
ISDN phone equipped with a Feature Package 3 Asynchronous Data Module.
In addition to the normal 7506/7507 display, keypad,
and call appearance/feature buttons, you get the ability to

	- label, add, delete, change, or move buttons
	- add local buttons (audix password, calling card numbers, etc)
	- do directory queries using the keyboard (no more keypad!)
	- create heirarchical speed call lists on a button 2 menu
	- maintain call history in a file on the UNIX host
	- display post database information on incoming calls
	- display voice and audix help menus
	- receive electronic mail when you get audix messages or miss calls
	- probably other things, but I forget right now...

You customize the interface in your startup file, including button placement
and speedcall list initialization.  You press buttons with the mouse, select
numbers from the speedcall menu, and never have to touch the keypad again.

REQUIREMENTS:
	1. You need a 7506 or 7507 set on your desk.
	2. You must allocate a serial port on your 730 terminal to connect to
		the port on the back of the phone.
	3. You should have extra memory in the 730 terminal, 'cause this
		is a large application to download.
	4. Your 7506/7507 set must have ADM2/Feature Package 3 (FP3) installed.

	(visdn still supports ProPhone 1.5 equipped ISDN sets, but bug fixes
	and enhancements are not guaranteed for this platform.  See the man
	page for backward compatibility info)

	visdn is compatible with the 730 IDM card.

HOW TO GET ADM2/FEATURE PACKAGE 3

	See ORDERING INFORMATION on the man page:

Type
	toolman visdn

for details on how to run visdn.
