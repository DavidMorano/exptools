     NAME
	  phonevouch - electronic Toll Discount	Approval Request Form
	  ATT363 processing

     SYNOPSIS
	  phonevouch [-i] [-b date] [-p] [-s] [name]

     DESCRIPTION
	  Phonevouch is	an electronic telephone	discount form
	  processing program.  It prompts you for the data you want to
	  put on the form, and generates a PostScript output file
	  which	it then	prints on a designated PostScript compatible
	  printer.  Personal data is stored into a setup file; you
	  will only be prompted	again for the information if an	error
	  is found in the setup	file.

	  In summary, it fills out the form, and draws it onto a blank
	  8.5x11" paper, suitable for signatures.

	  It does the addition and will	compute	the tax	amounts	for
	  you, if you tell it what your	tax rates are.

	  The name parameter is	useful in letting one person (ie: a
	  secretary) produce phone vouchers for	more than one person.
	  The string you use for the optional name is arbitrary, but
	  you are limited to a maximum length of 8 characters on UNIX,
	  or 3 characters if you are running this on PostScript
	  printer equipped MS-DOS machine (PC).
