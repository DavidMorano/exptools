2/2/94 news

On SVR4, Sun and Solaris systems which support job control, ^X-^C is now
bound to "suspend-emacs" instead of "exit-emacs". This actually is the way
that Gosling originally bound ^X-^C, but it hasn't been supported in the
exptools version because of lack of support for job control within UNIX
System V until now.

In a previous news item, I suggested binding suspend-emacs to ^X-^C, but
didn't realize that there was code already in there that hadn't been enabled
until now which already did the binding. This has been causing problems for
a few people, for which I apologize.

If you see the message

	[1] + Stopped (signal)         gmacs

from the shell, it means that you've suspended the gmacs session, and can
restart it again by typing the "fg" shell command.

If you wish to rebind ^X-^C back to "exit-emacs", add the following line to
your .emacs_pro file:

        (bind-to-key "exit-emacs" "\^X\^C")

If you don't have a .emacs_pro file, you are loading the default profile. If
you want to rebind ^X-^C back to "exit-emacs", create a .emacs_pro.ml file
with the following two lines:

        (bind-to-key "exit-emacs" "\^X\^C")
        (load "profile")

When using alternation within regular expression searches, as in "abc\|def",
there was no checking on the number of \|'s, even though internally, only
room for 9 was allocated. The limit has been raised to 31, and it now checks
to make sure you don't go past that limit.
