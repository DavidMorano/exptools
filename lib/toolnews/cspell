Version 3.3 of 'cspell' is installed.

Synopsis of tool:
'Cspell' is a tool that will check the spelling of
comments and strings in a file that contains C or C++
statements.  The reason for checking items in double
quotes is because many of these strings are eventually
output from the program.  Thus, it would be nice to
check their spelling.

Version 3.3 contains a bug fix for running with 4GL.
Now, you must give cspell the '-4' option to run against
a file that's written in 4GL.

See "toolman cspell" for more information.
