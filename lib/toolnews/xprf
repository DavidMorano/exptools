Subject: update to xprf document display tool for 630/730 terminals


Changes in new release:

1)  Now uses prtfmt to do the formatting if possible.  If prtfmt is not
    available, xprf will scan the input and produce its own formatting
    command string.

2)  The grap(1) and gc2pic(1) preprocessors are now supported.

3)  No longer depends on the soexpand tool.  Several other methods will be
    tried for expanding .so macros before trying soexpand.  If no .so macro
    expansion tool exists in the user's PATH, an error will be printed and
    xprf will abort.

4)  The -M option has been removed because the new formatter (prtfmt) is
    usually smart enough to know when not to include the MM macros.

5)  A new -C option has been added that will run xproof in the current window
    rather than calling agent to create a new xproof window.



			    SYNOPSIS

		xprf [-B] [-C] [-L] [troff_options] [filenames]

Xprf is a prtfmt-like front-end to the exptool xproof.  Xprf scans the
named input files to determine what preprocessors and macro packages
need to be used to format the files.  After the files have been formatted,
xprf creates a new window and runs the xproof tool to display the files.

Xprf supports both portrait mode (default) and landscape mode (-L option)
displays.  The tool will automatically create the largest possible 630/730
window that it can with the appropriate orientation.  This window will
then automatically be deleted when you exit xproof.

See the manual page for a complete description of the tool and its options.
