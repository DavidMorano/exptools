Dear vi4viterm users,

As of today I installed an evaluation copy of vi4viterm, I did not have the chance to test the package thougoroly. If you have any problems using the package please let me know. The package includes support for cscope and is derived from the package running on the intgp clusters.

Happy newyear, and have fun using vi4viterm


regards Michiel Los
