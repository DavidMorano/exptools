I have made one minor change to paren which will eliminate 99% of
the spurious complaints of assignment in a conditional context.

The -a option will now complain about:

	if (a = b)
		stuff;
	
but it will not complain about:

	if (a = b())
		stuff;

similarly for "while" and "for".  The -av option will complain
about the second one as well.
