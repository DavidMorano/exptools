mailnews 1.16D:
--------------

The From: line placed in the mail message by mailnews has been fixed
to include a real return email address, along with the comment that
causes the message to look like it came from "News from <user>".
Without the email address, some systems' mail handling routines dumped
core when trying to handle mail messages generated by mailnews.

OLD NEWS:
Have you ever considered reading system news items (/usr/news and
$TOOLS/lib/toolnews) or project bulletin board (e.g. $PROJECTDIR/bb)
items using the easy-to-use mail reading systems like mailx, post, or
what-have-you?

That would be better than watching the news items fly by with the
news, toolnews, or whatever command.

The
    mailnews
             tool reads simple news directories (like news does, NOT
like netnews), but packages each news item file into a mail message,
which it sends to your login with nice From:, Subject: and Posted:
headings.

This allows you to read news items ...
  a. at your convenience (news | pager may be OK until you have to quit
     to handle a crisis!  Plus that doesn't read the items ...),
  b. in any order (direct or "random" access),
  c. saving items, or printing them, using post/mailx's nice user
     interface (or whatever mail reader you use), and
  d. you can ignore/delete any item without having to read through it.

mailnews ...
  o  Doesn't require getting used to a new language or user interface,
     since you already know your mail reader!
  o  Allows you to set up a NEWSPATH environment variable.  Thereafter
     you usually need only type "mailnews" without options or arguments.
  o  Is fully supported (exptools support level 6) and has been around
     since March of 1986.
  o  Can be given a list of news items to skip, so you can ignore
     those repeat news items that are of no interest to you.
  o  Works with any simple (1 level) news directory, including project
     bulletin boards, etc.
