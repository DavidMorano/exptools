This is version 1.8 of BVI.  It does not contain any new features.
It does contain a few minor bug fixes, but the majority of the changes
this time are to enhance the MS-DOS version.  Memory allocation is now
cleaner, due to a change in compilers, and an annoying problem
introduced by MS-DOS 5.0 has been cleaned up.

The MS-DOS version of BVI is now available to AT&T employees, via
exptools.  There should be a copy in $TOOLS/lib/msdos/bvi.exe
on every exptools machine.  This is a self-extracting archive which,
when you run it, will expand into bvi18.exe and 3 documentation files.
