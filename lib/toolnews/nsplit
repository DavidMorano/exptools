This is an enhanced version of split. The major difference from split is
that it doesn't just work in units of lines; the units of characters,
512-byte blocks, 1000-byte kilos, 1024-byte Kilos, 1,000,000-byte megabytes
and 1,048,576-byte Megabytes are also supported. If you ever need a file
split into 50-byte chunks, or 63267-byte chunks, or 100,000-byte chunks,
nsplit makes it easy.

     NAME
	  nsplit - split a file	into pieces

     SYNOPSIS
	  nsplit [ -n [	lcbkKmM	] ] [ file [ name ] ]

     DESCRIPTION
    	  Nsplit is an enhanced	version	of split . Nsplit reads	file
	  and writes it	in n-size pieces onto a	set of output files.
	  Size is one of (l) lines , (c) characters , (b) (512-byte)
	  blocks , (k) kilos (1000-byte	blocks), (K) Kilos (1024-byte
	  blocks), (m) megabytes (1,000,000-byte blocks), or (M)
	  Megabytes (1,048,576-byte blocks, which is 1024*1024).  The
	  default size is in (l) lines . The default counts are	1000
	  lines, 50,000	characters, 100	blocks,	50 kilos, 50 Kilos, 1
	  megabyte or 1	Megabyte.  The name of the first output	file
	  is name with aa appended, and	so on lexicographically, up to
	  zz (a	maximum	of 676 files).	Name must be short enough to
	  add the two character	appendix.  If no output	name is	given,
	  x is default.

	  If no	input file is given, or	if - is	given in its stead,
	  then the standard input file is used.
