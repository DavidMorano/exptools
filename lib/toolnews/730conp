A new tool has been added to exptools for use on 730 terminals.  This
tool provides a data routing function which allows two physical ports
on the 730 to be tied together in a software sense.  730conp creates
two processes in the terminal which exchange the data comming from
the host port that each is associated to.

This allows a PC or other device to be connected to one of the RS232
ports on the terminal but have a virtual connection to an IDM or starlan
port (any port combination is possible, but RS232 to IDM or starlan is
the most useful).
