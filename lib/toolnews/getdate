Some getdate changes:

	1.  getdate now recognizes dates of the form 

			12-feb-1993

	2.  Format shift characters have been added to allow more
	    control over output capitalization.  For example,

		-f "%<%r %>%A %=%i"

	    will print the time (%r) in all lower case (am/pm), the
	    weekday name (%A) in all upper case, and the month name (%i)
	    in mixed case.

	3.  A bug has been fixed that gave the time "now" instead
	    of the time "23:59:59" when using the -p option with 
	    a day of the month earlier than today.  Thanks to
	    Bill McGovern for finding this.

	4.  A bug has been fixed that on some machines caused the
	    wrong adjustments to be made for standard time and
	    on other machines fetched the wrong time zone.
	    Thanks to Andrew Colby for pointing this out.

	5.  The shell parameter $TZ seems to be generally populated
	    correctly now.  We've removed the hard coded check and
	    taken out the warning in the man page under the BUGS
	    section.

	6.  There is a slightly more robust scanning algorithm for
	    reading datestrings that does not require spaces between
	    tokens.  getdate will now understand strings such as
	    "10pm" or "sept20" or "jan4,1993".

	7.  If you have a common date or time format that getdate
	    does not recognize, let us know so we can put it in
	    getdate.


If you have questions, comments, suggestions, etc., please
contact one or both of us.

Previous news:

A few minor changes to getdate have been made:

	1.  A new option has been installed:  -e for "earliest" date and
	    time consistent with the rest of the input line.
	    For example,

		$ getdate -e 2 pm
                Thu Oct  8 14:00:00 CDT 1992

		$ getdate -e april
                Thu Apr  1 00:00:00 CST 1993

	2.  A bug has been fixed in the interpretations of phrases
	    such as "next monday" and "last monday":

		$ getdate  Jan 1 2001 next monday
                Mon Jan  8 23:59:59 CST 2001

	3.  It is now possible to enter the day of the year:

		$ getdate 45 day of year
 		Sun Feb 14 23:59:59 CST 1993

		$ getdate 349 doy
		Mon Dec 14 23:59:59 CST 1992

	4.  A bug in the calculation of the Julian date has been fixed
	    (it sometimes caused the Julian day number to be low by 1).

	5.  It is now possible to enter Julian Dates:

		$ getdate julian date 234938292

		$ getdate jd 490294404

A new man page has been installed (dated 10/14/92) reflecting these
changes.
