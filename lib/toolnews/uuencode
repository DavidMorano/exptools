	uuencode and uudecode

The description of the format of a uuencoded file has been added to the
manual page.

----------------

Because of its usefulness and the apparent demand for it, uuencode and
uudecode have been installed in exptools. Uuencode takes an arbitrary file
and encodes it such that it contains strictly printable ASCII characters.
Uudecode reverses the process. Uuencode is useful for mailing a binary file
across multiple uucp hops.
