 dbnet and its associatted routines have been improved to:
   - get more interface control info from the server. THis presently
     only helps where I control the server (i.e. linus)
   - goes to linus.att.com for learning about DBs that do not explain
     themselves (e.g. Univ of CA, RLG). THis should make these DBs
     look much better.
   - Added yet more improvements for servers that support bare bones
     of the information retrieval standard I am using (Z39.50). These
     will always look bad, but are getting closer to working.
   - Improved connectivity so it can get out better using proxy.

 And at the bare minimum of functionality (their server restrictions)
you can now access the following DBs:
 1012  carl-dpl       Denver Public Library (CARL)                      
 1013  carl-mines     Colorado School of Mines (CARL)                   
 1014  carl-auraria   Auraria Higher Education Center (CARL)            
 1015  carl-boulder   University of Colorado at Boulder (CARL)          
 1016  carl-unc       University of Northern Colorado (CARL)            
 1017  carl-law       University of Denver Law Library (CARL)           
 1018  carl-wyoming   University of Wyoming (CARL)
