The diffc program has been updated on this machine. The diffc program
produces a context diff between two files. Its output is identical to that
produced by the "diff -c" option on UNIX System V release 4 and Berkeley
systems. The output is also what is expected to be read in by the "patch"
program.

Changes:

    A bug which occurred when one of the arguments was a directory name was
    fixed.

    Diffc now handles pipes. In particular, you can now specify stdin as an
    argument by using "-".

    The manual page was updated to better reflect the options.

See the diffc manual page for further information.
