ndiff is now available on this machine.

ndiff shades (diffshades, redlines) differences between troff
and nroff files for X9700 and postscript printers.

ndiff is similar in flavor to diffmk.  Two versions of a
troff (or nroff) file are compared and a third version
containing difference notation is generated.

The notation can contain three types of difference indicators:

	1.  Shaded text for new or modified text.
	2.  Overstruck text for old or deleted text.
	3.  Margin notes giving an indication of the extent of the
	    changes (the number of words deleted or changed)
	    and whether troff/nroff requests (formatting
	    commands) were modified.

For postscript printers, the syntax is usually:

	ndiff -Tpost oldfile newfile | prtfmt -Tpost

For more information, type

	toolman ndiff
