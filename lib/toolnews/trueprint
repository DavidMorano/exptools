Version 4.0

**Hopefully the last fix for platforms with non-ANSI C compilers

**This re-release fixes the broken diffs and the core dump:

New version with collaboration from the original author Lezz Giles.

Enhancements:

* Re-wrote module split to make updates easier and more logical.
* Re-wrote input handling to make it easier to handle end-of-file.
* Added PERL language support - the language parsing is not easy and you
  may find some regular expressions causing problems!
* Added old/new file specifications in the list of files handled by the
  -i option e.g. -<file> = old, +<file> = new. Works the same as the -O option
  but over more than one file.
* Added -xc exclusion option to not print the count of line numbers.
* Added limitation on point size (-p option) to avoid conflicts with users
  using -p instead of -o for 2on1 or 4on1 printing

This version is a first release of changes and ideas that could be applied
to the exptools version of trueprint. To see the latest information on
