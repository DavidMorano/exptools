In the past, lock logged the user off if an incorrect password
was entered three times. A newer version of UNIX blocks this and
causes lock to return to the login shell. This is, of course,
unacceptable. After discussion with security it was decided that
the best solution was to have lock just hang (does NOT use cpu cycles)
after five incorrect password attempts. To clear this condition
break the physical connection or kill lock from another terminal
using the same login.
