New versions of the graph layout programs "dot" and "neato"
have been installed.  "dot" draws directed graphs as hierarchies.
"neato" draws undirected graphs using force-directed placement.
Both employ a filter model of reading a text file that describes
a graph, and writing a picture in PostScript, Frame Maker MIF,
or HPGL/2.

User's guides for these programs can be obtained by ftp on
toucan.zoo.att.com, in outgoing/dotguide.ps.Z and 
outgoing/neatoguide.ps.Z.

"dot" has a new feature for making layouts with distinct
subgraphs ("clusters").  This is described in the user's guide.
Both "dot" and "neato" also run under DOS and executables can
be found under $TOOLS/lib/msdos.  Note that until someone comes
up with a Windows or at least VGA port, you will need a compatible
previewer or printer for the layouts.  You can ftp gs386.exe and
associated fonts from toucan.

We also have a prototype customizable graph viewer that runs
under X windows.  This viewer is named DOTTY and it is programmed
in a script language that is similar to shell or awk but handles
interactive graphics.  We feel that for some applications, this
is a good alternative to writing C programs that use X widgets.
A Sun-4 distribution of DOTTY (executable files, documentation,
sample graphs, and a few demos showing how it is customized) are
available by ftp from toucan.zoo.att.com, in outgoing/dotty.sun4.cpio.Z.

Please contact us if you need further information, if you
find any significant bugs, or if you have suggestions.
