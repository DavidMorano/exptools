EXPTOOLS

Welcome to AT&T Bell Laboratories Expperimental-Tools distribution.

These programs are collected from around the Labs and Centers from
people who thought that they might be useful to others.  This
collection not only contains original programs but some commonly
used programs that are out in NetLand that were not developed within
the Labs.  These other programs are maintained by someone within
the Labs who voluteered to do it.  Many of these other programs are
quite valuable in themselves.

Use the command 'toolman' to display manual pages for the programs
in this collection.
