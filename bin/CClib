You have just accessed a collection of C++ libraries that have been donated
by members of AT&T for the general use of development within the corporation.
YOU SHOULD READ THE MAN PAGE (\$TOOLS/man/1.CClib) FOR CCLIB BEFORE YOU 
CONTINUE.  The organization of the libraries is as follows:
 
\$TOOLS/lib/CClib/libname, libname being the library's name, is the directory 
set up to service the library (with man page in \$TOOLS/lib/CClib/man).  The 
provider of each library is located next to the library's name below. All bug 
reports, proposed fixes, and comments should be mailed to the provider of the 
relevant library, and, as a courtesy to other users of the library, to the 
netnews group att.lang.c++.  It is the provider's option to update the code. 

The command "toolnews CClib" displays relatively static information that 
should be of general interest to CClib users and providers (e.g., information
needed to contribute software to CClib). 

Included below is a list of current libraries with their locations, target
machines, providers, and inter-library dependencies (other dependencies are
documented with each library).  If you would like to contribute a library, 
please read the short set of instructions listed under "toolnews CClib." 
If you have questions concerning the administration of CClib, please contact 
the CClib provider listed under the exptools "providers" command.
