#Revamped by Dan_Jacobson@ATT.COM. 7/1990.  Now the user doesn't have
#to worry about the paths---we append them to the rear of her/his
#paths.  This should be fine for 99.9% of users... others could call
#virtex manually without using this script.  Note: here I use "<<-"
#and e.g., "${X:-Y}" (not just "${X-Y}") ...not compatible with some
#older /bin/sh's.  [We now return you the the original script as
#distributed.  It refers to many things and files that the average
#user need not be aware of or will not be able to find in the exptools
#distribution. End of Dan's comments.]

# This script provides an alternative to preloading TeX.  See the
# README.WEB-to-C file for the tradeoffs that come by doing things
# this way.  There is a short delay before TeX (LaTeX/SliTeX) gets
# working, but there is a greater flexibility, and a tremendous
# saving in disk space.  Only one compilation of initex and virtex
# needs to be stored, and it is much smaller than any preloaded image,
# or even than the preloaded file that results from using fmtdump.
# When TeX is invoked as tex, a private format_file (such as a 
# combination of lplain, amstex and pictex) can be loaded in place
# of one of the standards (be sure that the TEXFORMATS environment 
# is correct if you try this).  
# 
# At the University of Washington we use only the TeX with the
# BIGTEX.PATCH applied, so a format file of this size is easily
# accommodated (approximately 725 Kbytes).  Preloaded using undump, TeX
# with this format file would take up nearly 3 Megabytes of disk.  Even
# after using fmtdump, it would be quite large, and you would still have
# the virtex and *.fmt files as additional storage overhead.
# 
# To set this script up, copy it into a directory named in your
# path environment, and rename it tex.  Then link it (hard links
# are fine in this case) to latex and slitex, and insure that it
# is executable.
# 
# You invoke latex and slitex as usual, with a single input file
# argument (or no argument at all).  You can invoke tex with zero,
# one or two arguments.  If the second argument is present, it is 
# assumed to be a *.fmt file in your TEXFORMATS path.
