# This script provides an alternative to preloading Metafont.  See the
# README.WEB-to-C file for the tradeoffs that come by doing things this
# way.  There is a short delay before Metafont gets working, but there
# is a greater flexibility, and a tremendous saving in disk space.
# Only one compilation of inimf and virmf needs to be stored, and it is
# much smaller than any preloaded image, or even than the preloaded file
# that results from using fmtdump.
# 
# To set this script up, copy it into a directory named in your
# path environment, rename it mf, and insure that it is executable.
