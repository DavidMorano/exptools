# This routine breaks its filename argument into a sequence, in descending
# order, of the directories the argument is contained in, ending finally
# in the filename itself.  This is useful for generating a list of directory
# names to be fed to an 'xargs' command to check or change all the directories
# above a given filename, to make sure, for example, that they exist, or are
# writable.
